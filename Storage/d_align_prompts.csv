0,"Paracetamol poisoning also known as acetaminophen poisoning is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24 hours following overdose. These include feeling tired abdominal pain or nausea. This is typically followed by a couple of days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin blood clotting problems and confusion occurs as a result of liver failure. Additional complications may include kidney failure pancreatitis low blood sugar and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.Paracetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as an attempt to die by suicide. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism malnutrition and the taking of certain other hepatotoxic medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself but from one of its metabolites N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the livers glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.Treatment may include activated charcoal if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If there is a potential for toxicity the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH high blood lactate poor blood clotting or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.Paracetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s. Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world. In the United States more than 100000 cases occur a year. In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses. Young children are most commonly affected. In the United States and the United Kingdom paracetamol is the most common cause of acute liver failure.Signs and symptomsThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose and consists of nausea vomiting a pale appearance and sweating. However patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely after massive overdoses patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.The second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.The third phase follows at 3 to 5 days and is marked by complications of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects low blood sugar kidney failure hepatic encephalopathy brain swelling sepsis multiple organ failure and death. If the third phase is survived the liver necrosis runs its course and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.CauseThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight whichever is lower have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels. Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.Intentional overdosing (self-poisoning with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity. In a 2006 review paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.In rare individuals paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use. This may be due to individual (""idiosyncratic"") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamols metabolism).Risk factorsA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1 thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.Fasting is a risk factor possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer isoniazid increases the risk of hepatotoxicity though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine phenytoin and barbiturates have also been reported as risk factors.PathophysiologyWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses paracetamol has been shown to be safe. Following a therapeutic dose it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via Phase II metabolism by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide with a small portion being oxidized via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Cytochromes P450 2E1 and 3A4 convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Under normal conditions NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.In cases of paracetamol overdose the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies the livers stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.DiagnosisA persons history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975 called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.Clinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days although in severe cases it may be evident in 12 hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST ALT bilirubin and prolonged coagulation times particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10000 IU/L.Detection in body fluidsParacetamol may be quantified in blood plasma or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L which equals 200 μmol/L. Levels of 30–300 mg/L (200–2000 μmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.PreventionLimitation of availabilityLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500 mg tablets in pharmacies and 16 x 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacists discretion. In Ireland the limits are 24 and 12 tablets respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.One suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine or to remove it entirely from the market. However overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.Combination with other agentsOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg methionine an amino acid formerly used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.There have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote acetylcysteine.Calcitriol the active metabolite of vitamin D3 appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production. Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42% increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration. It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol via injection may improve treatment outcomes.Paracetamol replacementsParacetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA) a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1 whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.TreatmentGastric decontaminationIn adults the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage better known as stomach pumping may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.It appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcysteine has no interaction with activated charcoal.Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac has no role in paracetamol overdose because the vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage activated charcoal or syrup of ipecac.AcetylcysteineAcetylcysteine also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC works to reduce paracetamol toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite so that it does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally acetylcysteine has been shown to be a more effective antidote particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion and for those who present with liver failure symptoms.If the person presents less than eight hours after paracetamol overdose then acetylcysteine significantly reduces the risk of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8 hours after ingestion there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48 hours after ingestion. If the person presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose then activated charcoal is not useful and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.In United States practice intravenous (IV) and oral administration are considered to be equally effective and safe if given within 8 hours of ingestion. However IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140 mg/kg loading dose followed by 70 mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste odor and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.Intravenous acetylcysteine is given as a continuous infusion over 20 hours for a total dose 300 mg/kg. Recommended administration involves infusion of a 150 mg/kg loading dose over 15 to 60 minutes followed by a 50 mg/kg infusion over four hours; the last 100 mg/kg are infused over the remaining 16 hours of the protocol. Intravenous acetylcysteine has the advantage of shortening hospital stay increasing both doctor and patient convenience and allowing administration of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of both the paracetamol and any co-ingested drugs without concerns about interference with oral acetylcysteine.  Intravenous dosing varies with weight specifically in children. For patients less than 20 kg the loading dose is 150 mg/kg in 3 mL/kg diluent administered over 60 minutes; the second dose is 50 mg/kg in 7 mL/kg diluent over 4 hours; and the third and final dose is 100 mg/kg in 14 mL/kg diluent over 16 hours.The most common adverse effect to acetylcysteine treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction usually manifested by rash wheeze or mild hypotension. May cause infertility or death. Adverse reactions are more common in people treated with IV acetylcysteine occurring in up to 20% of patients. Anaphylactoid reactions are more likely to occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis and may be characterized by respiratory distress facial swelling and even death.If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or slowed and antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be indicated in the event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine). It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.Liver transplantIn people who develop acute liver failure or who are otherwise expected to die from liver failure the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at Kings College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds and a serum creatinine greater than 300 mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques have the advantage of supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication for the rest of their lives.PrognosisThe mortality rate from paracetamol overdose increases two days after the ingestion reaches a maximum on day four and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A mortality rate of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or worse) hepatic encephalopathy a markedly elevated prothrombin time or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality) whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.EpidemiologyMany over-the-counter and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of its wide availability paired with comparably high toxicity (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) there is a much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States the United Kingdom Australia and New Zealand paracetamol is the most common cause of drug overdoses. Additionally in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure.In England and Wales an estimated 41200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990 with a mortality of 0.40%. It is estimated that 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur as a result of poisoning each year in England and Wales. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance accounting for more than 100000 calls as well as 56000 emergency room visits 2600 hospitalizations and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults and 25% of cases in children.ReferencesExternal linksGerth Jeff; T.

1,"Acromegaly is a disorder that results from excess growth hormone (GH) after the growth plates have closed. The initial symptom is typically enlargement of the hands and feet. There may also be an enlargement of the forehead jaw and nose. Other symptoms may include joint pain thicker skin deepening of the voice headaches and problems with vision. Complications of the disease may include type 2 diabetes sleep apnea and high blood pressure.Acromegaly is usually caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone. In more than 95% of cases the excess production is due to a benign tumor known as a pituitary adenoma. The condition is not inherited from a persons parents. Acromegaly is rarely due to a tumor in another part of the body. Diagnosis is by measuring growth hormone after a person has consumed a glucose solution or by measuring insulin-like growth factor I in the blood. After diagnosis medical imaging of the pituitary is carried out to determine if an adenoma is present. If excess growth hormone is produced during childhood the result is the condition gigantism rather than acromegaly and it is characterized by excessive height.Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor medications and radiation therapy. Surgery is usually the preferred treatment; the smaller the tumor the more likely surgery will be curative. If surgery is contraindicated or not curative somatostatin analogues or GH receptor antagonists may be used. Radiation therapy may be used if neither surgery nor medications are completely effective. Without treatment life expectancy is reduced by 10 years; with treatment life expectancy is not reduced.Acromegaly affects about 3 per 50000 people. It is most commonly diagnosed in middle age. Males and females are affected with equal frequency. It was first described in the medical literature by Nicolas Saucerotte in 1772. The term is from the Greek ἄκρον (akron) meaning ""extremity"" and μέγα (mega) meaning ""large"".Signs and symptomsFeatures that may result from a high level of GH or expanding tumor include:Headaches – often severe and prolongedSoft tissue swelling visibly resulting in enlargement of the hands feet nose lips and ears and a general thickening of the skinSoft tissue swelling of internal organs notably the heart with the attendant weakening of its muscularity and the kidneys also the vocal cords resulting in a characteristic thick deep voice and slowing of speechGeneralized expansion of the skull at the fontanellePronounced brow protrusion often with ocular distension (frontal bossing)Pronounced lower jaw protrusion (prognathism) with attendant macroglossia (enlargement of the tongue) and teeth spacingHypertrichosis hyperpigmentation and hyperhidrosis may occur in these people.: 499 Skin tagsCarpal tunnel syndromeComplicationsProblems with bones and joints including osteoarthritis nerve compression syndrome due to bony overgrowth and carpal tunnel syndromeHypertensionDiabetes mellitusCardiomyopathy potentially leading to heart failureColorectal cancerSleep ApneaThyroid nodules and thyroid cancerHypogonadismCompression of the optic chiasm by the growth of pituitary adenoma leading to visual problemsCausesPituitary adenomaAbout 98% of cases of acromegaly are due to the overproduction of growth hormone by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland called an adenoma. These tumors produce excessive growth hormone and compress surrounding brain tissues as they grow larger. In some cases they may compress the optic nerves. Expansion of the tumor may cause headaches and visual disturbances. In addition compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones leading to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and impotence in men because of reduced testosterone production.A marked variation in rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor occurs. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the sinuses which are located near the pituitary. In general younger people tend to have more aggressive tumors.Most pituitary tumors arise spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. Many pituitary tumors arise from a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell that leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change or mutation is not present at birth but is acquired during life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells; it permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete growth hormones. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.Pituitary adenomas and diffuse somatomammotroph hyperplasia may result from somatic mutations activating GNAS which may be acquired or associated with McCune-Albright syndrome.Other tumorsIn a few people acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas lungs and adrenal glands. These tumors also lead to an excess of GH either because they produce GH themselves or more frequently because they produce GHRH (growth hormone-releasing hormone) the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. In these people the excess GHRH can be measured in the blood and establishes that the cause of the acromegaly is not due to a pituitary defect. When these nonpituitary tumors are surgically removed GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.In people with GHRH-producing non-pituitary tumors the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Therefore it is important that physicians carefully analyze all ""pituitary tumors"" removed from people with acromegaly so as to not overlook the possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder.DiagnosisIf acromegaly is suspected medical laboratory investigations followed by medical imaging if the lab tests are positive confirms or rules out the presence of this condition.IGF1 provides the most sensitive lab test for the diagnosis of acromegaly and a GH suppression test following an oral glucose load which is a very specific lab test will confirm the diagnosis following a positive screening test for IGF1. A single value of the GH is not useful in view of its pulsatility (levels in the blood vary greatly even in healthy individuals). GH levels taken 2 hours after a 75- or 100-gram glucose tolerance test are helpful in the diagnosis: GH levels are suppressed below 1 μg/L in normal people and levels higher than this cutoff are confirmatory of acromegaly.Other pituitary hormones must be assessed to address the secretory effects of the tumor as well as the mass effect of the tumor on the normal pituitary gland. They include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) gonadotropic hormones (FSH LH) adrenocorticotropic hormone and prolactin.An MRI of the brain focusing on the sella turcica after gadolinium administration allows for clear delineation of the pituitary and the hypothalamus and the location of the tumor. A number of other overgrowth syndromes can result in similar problems.Differential diagnosisPseudoacromegaly is a condition with the usual acromegaloid features but without an increase in growth hormone and IGF-1. It is frequently associated with insulin resistance. Cases have been reported due to minoxidil at an unusually high dose. It can also be caused by a selective post receptor defect of insulin signalling leading to the impairment of metabolic but preservation of mitogenic signalling.TreatmentThe goals of treatment are to reduce GH production to normal levels thereby reversing or ameliorating the signs and symptoms of acromegaly to relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor exerts on the surrounding brain areas and to preserve normal pituitary function. Currently treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor drug therapy and radiation therapy of the pituitary.MedicationsSomatostatin analoguesThe primary current medical treatment of acromegaly is to use somatostatin analogues – octreotide (Sandostatin) or lanreotide (Somatuline).These somatostatin analogues are synthetic forms of a brain hormone somatostatin which stops GH production. The long-acting forms of these drugs must be injected every 2 to 4 weeks for effective treatment. Most people with acromegaly respond to this medication. In many people with acromegaly GH levels fall within one hour and headaches improve within minutes after the injection. Octreotide and lanreotide are effective for long-term treatment. Octreotide and lanreotide have also been used successfully to treat people with acromegaly caused by non-pituitary tumors.Somatostatin analogues are also sometimes used to shrink large tumors before surgery.Because octreotide inhibits gastrointestinal and pancreatic function long-term use causes digestive problems such as loose stools nausea and gas in one third of people. In addition approximately 25 percent of people with acromegaly develop gallstones which are usually asymptomatic. In some cases octreotide treatment can cause diabetes due to the fact that somatostatin and its analogues can inhibit the release of insulin. With an aggressive adenoma that is not able to be operated on there may be a resistance to octreotide and in which case a second generation SSA pasireotide may be used for tumor control. However insulin and glucose levels should be carefully monitored as pasireotide has been associated with hyperglycemia by reducing insulin secretion.Dopamine agonistsFor those who are unresponsive to somatostatin analogues or for whom they are otherwise contraindicated it is possible to treat using one of the dopamine agonists bromocriptine or cabergoline. As tablets rather than injections they cost considerably less. These drugs can also be used as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue therapy. They are most effective in those whose pituitary tumours cosecrete prolactin. Side effects of these dopamine agonists include gastrointestinal upset nausea vomiting light-headedness when standing and nasal congestion. These side effects can be reduced or eliminated if medication is started at a very low dose at bedtime taken with food and gradually increased to the full therapeutic dose. Bromocriptine lowers GH and IGF-1 levels and reduces tumor size in fewer than half of people with acromegaly. Some people report improvement in their symptoms although their GH and IGF-1 levels still are elevated.Growth hormone receptor antagonistsThe latest development in the medical treatment of acromegaly is the use of growth hormone receptor antagonists. The only available member of this family is pegvisomant (Somavert). By blocking the action of the endogenous growth hormone molecules this compound is able to control the disease activity of acromegaly in virtually everyone with acromegaly. Pegvisomant has to be administered subcutaneously by daily injections. Combinations of long-acting somatostatin analogues and weekly injections of pegvisomant seem to be equally effective as daily injections of pegvisomant.SurgerySurgical removal of the pituitary tumor is usually effective in lowering growth hormone levels. Two surgical procedures are available for use. The first is endonasal transsphenoidal surgery which involves the surgeon reaching the pituitary through an incision in the nasal cavity wall. The wall is reached by passing through the nostrils with microsurgical instruments. The second method is transsphenoidal surgery during which an incision is made into the gum beneath the upper lip. Further incisions are made to cut through the septum to reach the nasal cavity where the pituitary is located. Endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is a less invasive procedure with a shorter recovery time than the older method of transsphenoidal surgery and the likelihood of removing the entire tumor is greater with reduced side effects. Consequently endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is the more common surgical choice.These procedures normally relieve the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and lead to a lowering of GH levels. Surgery is most successful in people with blood GH levels below 40 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 mm in diameter. Success depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is the normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Ideally GH should be less than 2 ng/ml after an oral glucose load. A review of GH levels in 1360 people worldwide immediately after surgery revealed that 60% had random GH levels below 5 ng/ml. Complications of surgery may include cerebrospinal fluid leaks meningitis or damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue requiring lifelong pituitary hormone replacement.Even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal people must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence. More commonly hormone levels may improve but not return completely to normal. These people may then require additional treatment usually with medications.Radiation therapyRadiation therapy has been used both as a primary treatment and combined with surgery or drugs. It is usually reserved for people who have tumor remaining after surgery. These people often also receive medication to lower GH levels. Radiation therapy is given in divided doses over four to six weeks. This treatment lowers GH levels by about 50 percent over 2 to 5 years. People monitored for more than 5 years show significant further improvement. Radiation therapy causes a gradual loss of production of other pituitary hormones with time. Loss of vision and brain injury which have been reported are very rare complications of radiation treatments.Selection of treatmentThe initial treatment chosen should be individualized depending on the persons characteristics such as age and tumor size. If the tumor has not yet invaded surrounding brain tissues removal of the pituitary adenoma by an experienced neurosurgeon is usually the first choice. After surgery a person must be monitored long-term for increasing GH levels.If surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs a doctor will usually begin additional drug therapy. The current first choice is generally octreotide or lanreotide; however bromocriptine and cabergoline are both cheaper and easier to administer. With all of these medications long-term therapy is necessary because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion.Radiation therapy is generally used for people whose tumors are not completely removed by surgery for people who are not good candidates for surgery because of other health problems and for people who do not respond adequately to surgery and medication.PrognosisLife expectancy of people with acromegaly is dependent on how early the disease is detected. Life expectancy after the successful treatment of early disease is equal to that of the general population. Acromegaly can often go on for years before diagnosis resulting in poorer outcome and it is suggested that the better the growth hormone is controlled the better the outcome. Upon successful surgical treatment headaches and visual symptoms tend to resolve. One exception is sleep apnea which is present in around 70% of cases but does not tend to resolve with successful treatment of growth hormone level. While hypertension is a complication of 40% of cases it typically responds well to regular regimens of blood pressure medication. Diabetes that occurs with acromegaly is treated with the typical medications but successful lowering of growth hormone levels often alleviates symptoms of diabetes. Hypogonadism without gonad destruction is reversible with treatment. Acromegaly is associated with a slightly elevated risk of cancer.Notable peopleFamous people with acromegaly include:Daniel Cajanus (1704–1749) ""The Finnish Goliath"". His natural size portrait and femur are still extant.

He had his pituitary tumor removed in 2012 at age 39.Primo Carnera (1906–1967) nicknamed the Ambling Alp was an Italian professional boxer and wrestler who reigned as the boxing World Heavyweight Champion from 29 June 1933 to 14 June 1934.Maurice Tillet (1903–1954) Russian-born French professional wrestler is better known by his ring name the French Angel.Richard Kiel (1939–2014) actor ""Jaws"" from two James Bond movies and Mr. Larson in Happy GilmorePío Pico the last Mexican Governor of California (1801–1894) manifested acromegaly without gigantism between at least 1847 and 1858. Some time after 1858 signs of the growth hormone-producing tumor disappeared along with all the secondary effects the tumor had caused in him. He looked normal in his 90s. His remarkable recovery is likely an example of spontaneous selective pituitary tumor apoplexy.Earl Nightingale (March 12 1921 – March 25 1989) was an American radio speaker and author dealing mostly with the subjects of human character development motivation and meaningful existence. He was the voice during the early 1950s of Sky King the hero of a radio adventure series and was a WGN radio program host from 1950 to 1956.

2,"Actinic keratosis (AK) sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis is a pre-cancerous area of thick scaly or crusty skin. Actinic keratosis is a disorder (-osis) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (actin-). These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature if left untreated they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended.Actinic keratoses characteristically appear as thick scaly or crusty areas that often feel dry or rough. Size commonly ranges between 2 and 6 millimeters but they can grow to be several centimeters in diameter.  Notably AKs are often felt before they are seen and the texture is sometimes compared to sandpaper. They may be dark light tan pink red a combination of all these or have the same color as the surrounding skin.Given the causal relationship between sun exposure and AK growth they often appear on a background of sun-damaged skin and in areas that are commonly sun-exposed such as the face ears neck scalp chest backs of hands forearms or lips.  Because sun exposure is rarely limited to a small area most people who have an AK have more than one.If clinical examination findings are not typical of AK and the possibility of in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cannot be excluded based on clinical examination alone a biopsy or excision can be considered for definitive diagnosis by histologic examination of the lesional tissue. Multiple treatment options for AK are available. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one option the treatment of numerous AK lesions in a region of the skin termed field cancerization. It involves the application of a photosensitizer to the skin followed by illumination with a strong light source. Topical creams such as 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod may require daily application to affected skin areas over a typical time course of weeks.Cryotherapy is frequently used for few and well-defined lesions but undesired skin lightening or hypopigmentation may occur at the treatment site. By following up with a dermatologist AKs can be treated before they progress to skin cancer. If cancer does develop from an AK lesion it can be caught early with close monitoring at a time when treatment is likely to have a high cure rate.Signs and symptomsActinic keratoses (AKs) most commonly present as a white scaly plaque of variable thickness with surrounding redness; they are most notable for having a sandpaper-like texture when felt with a gloved hand. Skin nearby the lesion often shows evidence of solar damage characterized by notable pigmentary alterations being yellow or pale in color with areas of hyperpigmentation; deep wrinkles coarse texture purpura and ecchymoses dry skin and scattered telangiectasias are also characteristic.Photoaging leads to an accumulation of oncogenic changes resulting in a proliferation of mutated keratinocytes that can manifest as AKs or other neoplastic growths. With years of sun damage it is possible to develop multiple AKs in a single area on the skin.  This condition is termed field cancerization.The lesions are usually asymptomatic but can be tender itch bleed or produce a stinging or burning sensation. AKs are typically graded in accordance with their clinical presentation: Grade I (easily visible slightly palpable) Grade II (easily visible palpable) and Grade III (frankly visible and hyperkeratotic).VariantsActinic keratoses can have various clinical presentations often characterized as follows:Classic (or common): Classic AKs present as white scaly macules papules or plaques of various thickness often with surrounding erythema. They are usually 2–6mm in diameter but can sometimes reach several centimeters in diameter.Hypertrophic (or hyperkeratotic): Hypertrophic AKs (HAKs) appears as a thicker scale or rough papule or plaque often adherent to an erythematous base. Classic AKs can progress to become HAKs and HAKs themselves can be difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions.Atrophic: Atrophic AKs lack an overlying scale and therefore appear as a nonpalpable change in color (or macule). They are often smooth and red and are less than 10mm in diameter.AK with cutaneous horn: A cutaneous horn is a keratinic projection with its height at least one-half of its diameter often conical in shape. They can be seen in the setting of actinic keratosis as a progression of an HAK but are also present in other skin conditions. 38–40% of cutaneous horns represent AKs.Pigmented AK: Pigmented AKs are rare variants that often present as macules or plaques that are tan to brown in color. They can be difficult to distinguish from a solar lentigo or lentigo maligna.Actinic cheilitis: When an AK forms on the lip it is called actinic cheilitis. This usually presents as a rough scaly patch on the lip often accompanied by the sensation of dry mouth and symptomatic splitting of the lips.Bowenoid AK: Usually presents as a solitary erythematous scaly patch or plaque with well-defined borders. Bowenoid AKs are differentiated from Bowens disease by degree of epithelial involvement as seen on histology.The presence of ulceration nodularity or bleeding should raise concern for malignancy. Specifically clinical findings suggesting an increased risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma can be recognized as ""IDRBEU"": I (induration/inflammation) D (diameter > 1 cm) R (rapid enlargement) B (bleeding) E (erythema) and U (ulceration). AKs are usually diagnosed clinically but because they are difficult to clinically differentiate from squamous cell carcinoma any concerning features warrant biopsy for diagnostic confirmation.CausesThe most important cause of AK formation is solar radiation through a variety of mechanisms.  Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene induced by UV radiation has been identified as a crucial step in AK formation. This tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17p132 allows for cell cycle arrest when DNA or RNA is damaged. Dysregulation of the p53 pathway can thus result in unchecked replication of dysplastic keratinocytes thereby serving as a source of neoplastic growth and the development of AK as well as possible progression from AK to skin cancer. Other molecular markers that have been associated with the development of AK include the expression of p16ink4 p14 the CD95 ligand TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TRAIL receptors and loss of heterozygosity.Evidence also suggests that the human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a role in the development of AKs. The HPV virus has been detected in AKs with measurable HPV viral loads (one HPV-DNA copy per less than 50 cells) measured in 40% of AKs. Similar to UV radiation higher levels of HPV found in AKs reflect enhanced viral DNA replication.  This is suspected to be related to the abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in AKs which facilitate an environment for HPV replication. This in turn may further stimulate the abnormal proliferation that contributes to the development of AKs and carcinogenesis.Ultraviolet radiationIt is thought that ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces mutations in the keratinocytes of the epidermis promoting the survival and proliferation of these atypical cells. Both UV-A and UV-B radiation have been implicated as causes of AKs.  UV-A radiation (wavelength 320–400 nm) reaches more deeply into the skin and can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species which in turn can damage cell membranes signaling proteins and nucleic acids.  UV-B radiation (wavelength 290–320 nm) causes thymidine dimer formation in DNA and RNA leading to significant cellular mutations.  In particular mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found in 30–50% of AK lesion skin samples.UV radiation has also been shown to cause elevated inflammatory markers such as arachidonic acid as well as other molecules associated with inflammation.  Eventually over time these changes lead to the formation of AKs.  Several predictors for increased AK risk from UV radiation have been identified:Extent of sun exposure: Cumulative sun exposure leads to an increased risk for development of AKs. In one U.S. study AKs were found in 55% of fair-skinned men with high cumulative sun exposure and in only 19% of fair-skinned men with low cumulative sun exposure in an age-matched cohort (the percents for women in this same study were 37% and 12% respectively). Furthermore the use of sunscreen (SPF 17 or higher) has been found to significantly reduce the development of AK lesions and also promotes the regression of existing lesions.History of sunburn: Studies show that even a single episode of painful sunburn as a child can increase an individuals risk of developing AK as an adult. Six or more painful sunburns over the course of a lifetime was found to be significantly associated with the likelihood of developing AK.Skin pigmentationMelanin is a pigment in the epidermis that functions to protect keratinocytes from the damage caused by UV radiation; it is found in higher concentrations in the epidermis of darker-skinned individuals affording them protection against the development of AKs.Fair-skinned individuals have a significantly increased risk of developing AKs when compared to olive-skinned individuals (odds ratios of 14.1 and 6.5 respectively) and AKs are uncommon in dark-skinned people of African descent. Other phenotypic features seen in fair-skinned individuals that are associated with an increased propensity to develop AKs include:FrecklingLight hair and eye colorPropensity to sunburnInability to tanOther risk factorsImmunosuppression: People with a compromised immune system from medical conditions (such as AIDS) or immunosuppressive therapy (such as chronic immunosuppression after organ transplantation or chemotherapy for cancer) are at increased risk for developing AKs. They may develop AK at an earlier age or have an increased number of AK lesions compared to immunocompetent people.Human papillomavirus (HPV): The role of HPV in the development of AK remains unclear but evidence suggests that infection with the betapapillomavirus type of HPV may be associated with an increased likelihood of AK.Genodermatoses: Certain genetic disorders interfere with DNA repair after sun exposure thereby putting these individuals at higher risk for the development of AKs. Examples of such genetic disorders include xeroderma pigmentosum and Bloom syndrome.Balding: AKs are commonly found on the scalps of balding men. The degree of baldness seems to be a risk factor for lesion development as men with severe baldness were found to be seven times more likely to have 10 or more AKs when compared to men with minimal or no baldness. This observation can be explained by an absence of hair causing a larger proportion of scalp to be exposed to UV radiation if other sun protection measures are not taken.DiagnosisPhysicians usually diagnose actinic keratosis by doing a thorough physical examination through a combination of visual observation and touch. However a biopsy may be necessary when the keratosis is large in diameter thick or bleeding in order to make sure that the lesion is not a skin cancer. Actinic keratosis may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but both diseases can present similarly upon physical exam and can be difficult to distinguish clinically. Histological examination of the lesion from a biopsy or excision may be necessary to definitively distinguish AK from in situ or invasive SCC. In addition to SCCs AKs can be mistaken for other cutaneous lesions including seborrheic keratoses basal cell carcinoma lichenoid keratosis porokeratosis viral warts erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp pemphigus foliaceus inflammatory dermatoses like psoriasis or melanoma.BiopsyA lesion biopsy is performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain after a clinical physical exam or if there is suspicion that the AK might have progressed to squamous cell carcinoma. The most common tissue sampling techniques include shave or punch biopsy. When only a portion of the lesion can be removed due to its size or location the biopsy should sample tissue from the thickest area of the lesion as SCCs are most likely to be detected in that area.If a shave biopsy is performed it should extend through to the level of the dermis in order to provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis; ideally it would extend to the mid-reticular dermis. Punch biopsy usually extends to the subcutaneous fat when the entire length of the punch blade is utilized.HistopathologyOn histologic examination actinic keratoses usually show a collection of atypical keratinocytes with hyperpigmented or pleomorphic nuclei extending to the basal layer of the epidermis. A ""flag sign"" is often described referring to alternating areas of orthokeratosis and parakeratosis. Epidermal thickening and surrounding areas of sun-damaged skin are often seen. The normal ordered maturation of the keratinocytes is disordered to varying degrees: there may be widening of the intracellular spaces cytologic atypia such as abnormally large nuclei and a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate.Specific findings depend on the clinical variant and particular lesion characteristics. The seven major histopathologic variants are all characterized by atypical keratinocytic proliferation beginning in the basal layer and confined to the epidermis; they include:Hypertrophic: Notable for marked hyperkeratosis often with evident parakeratosis. Keratinocytes in the stratum malphigii may show a loss of polarity pleomorphism and anaplasia. Some irregular downward proliferation into the uppermost dermis may be observed but does not represent frank invasion.Atrophic: With slight hyperkeratosis and overall atrophic changes to the epidermis; the basal layer shows cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei in close proximity to each other. These cells have been observed to proliferate into the dermis as buds and duct-like structures.Lichenoid: Demonstrate a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis directly beneath the dermal-epidermal junction.Achantholytic: Intercellular clefts or lacunae in the lowermost epidermal layer that result from anaplastic changes; these produce dyskeratotic cells with disrupted intercellular bridges.Bowenoid: This term is controversial and usually refers to full-thickness atypia microscopically indistinguishable from Bowens Disease. However most dermatologists and pathologists will use it in reference to tissue samples that are notable for small foci of atypia that involve the full thickness of the epidermis in the background of a lesion that is otherwise consistent with an AK.Epidermolytic: With granular degeneration.Pigmented: Show pigmentation in the basal layer of the epidermis similar to a solar lentigo.DermoscopyDermoscopy is a noninvasive technique utilizing a handheld magnifying device coupled with a transilluminating lift. It is often used in the evaluation of cutaneous lesions but lacks the definitive diagnostic ability of biopsy-based tissue diagnosis. Histopathologic exam remains the gold standard.Polarized contact dermoscopy of AKs occasionally reveals a ""rosette sign"" described as four white points arranged in a clover pattern often localized to within a follicular opening. It is hypothesized that the ""rosette sign"" corresponds histologically to the changes of orthokeratosis and parakeratosis known as the ""flag sign.""Non-pigmented AKs: linear or wavy vascular patterning or a ""strawberry pattern"" described as unfocused vessels between hair follicles with white-haloed follicular openings.Pigmented AKs: gray to brown dots or globules surrounding follicular openings and annular-granular rhomboidal structures; often difficult to differentiate from lentigo maligna.PreventionUltraviolet radiation is believed to contribute to the development of actinic keratoses by inducing mutations in epidermal keratinocytes leading to proliferation of atypical cells. Therefore preventive measures for AKs are targeted at limiting exposure to solar radiation including:Limiting extent of sun exposureAvoid sun exposure during noontime hours between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM when UV light is most powerfulMinimize all time in the sun since UV exposure occurs even in the winter and on cloudy daysUsing sun protectionApplying sunscreens with SPF ratings 30 or greater that also block both UVA and UVB light at least every 2 hours and after swimming or sweatingApplying sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside as this allows time for the sunscreen to be absorbed appropriately by the skinWearing sun protective clothing such as hats sunglasses long-sleeved shirts long skirts or trousersRecent research implicating human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of AKs suggests that HPV prevention might in turn help prevent development of AKs as UV-induced mutations and oncogenic transformation are likely facilitated in cases of active HPV infection.  A key component of HPV prevention includes vaccination and the CDC currently recommends routine vaccination in all children at age 11 or 12.There is some data that in individuals with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer a low-fat diet can serve as a preventative measure against future actinic keratoses.ManagementThere are a variety of treatment options for AK depending on the patient and the clinical characteristics of the lesion.  AKs show a wide range of features which guide decision-making in choosing treatment. As there are multiple effective treatments patient preference and lifestyle are also factors that physicians consider when determining the management plan for actinic keratosis. Regular follow-up is advisable after any treatment to make sure no new lesions have developed and that old ones are not progressing. Adding topical treatment after a procedure may improve outcomes.MedicationTopical medications are often recommended for areas where multiple or ill-defined AKs are present as the medication can easily be used to treat a relatively large area.Fluorouracil creamTopical fluorouracil (5-FU) destroys AKs by blocking methylation of thymidylate synthetase thereby interrupting DNA and RNA synthesis. This in turn prevents the proliferation of dysplastic cells in AK. Topical 5-FU is the most utilized treatment for AK and often results in effective removal of the lesion. Overall there is a 50% efficacy rate resulting in 100% clearance of AKs treated with topical 5-FU. 5-FU may be up to 90% effective in treating non-hyperkeratotic lesions. While topical 5-FU is a widely used and cost-effective treatment for AKs and is generally well tolerated its potential side-effects can include: pain crusting redness and local swelling. These adverse effects can be mitigated or minimized by reducing the frequency of application or taking breaks between uses. The most commonly used application regimen consists of applying a layer of topical cream to the lesion twice a day after washing; duration of treatment is typically 2–4 weeks to thinner skin like the cheeks and up to 8 weeks for the arms; treatment of up to 8 weeks has demonstrated a higher cure rate.Imiquimod creamImiquimod is a topical immune-enhancing agent licensed for the treatment of genital warts. Imiquimod stimulates the immune system through the release and up-regulation of cytokines. Treatment with Imiquimod cream applied 2–3 times per week for 12 to 16 weeks was found to result in complete resolution of AKs in 50% of people compared to 5% of controls. The Imiquimod 3.75% cream has been validated in a treatment regimen consisting of daily application to entire face and scalp for two 2-week treatment cycles with a complete clearance rate of 36%.While the clearance rate observed with the Imiquimod 3.75% cream was lower than that observed with the 5% cream (36 and 50 percent respectively) there are lower reported rates of adverse reactions with the 3.75% cream: 19% of individuals using Imiquimod 3.75% cream reported adverse reactions including local erythema scabbing and flaking at the application site while nearly a third of individuals using the 5% cream reported the same types of reactions with Imiquimod treatment. However it is ultimately difficult to compare the efficacy of the different strength creams directly as current study data varies in methodology (e.g. duration and frequency of treatment and amount of skin surface area covered).Ingenol mebutate gelIngenol mebutate is a newer treatment for AK used in Europe and the United States. It works in two ways first by disrupting cell membranes and mitochondria resulting cell death and then by inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to eliminate remaining tumor cells. A 3-day treatment course with the 0.015% gel is recommended for the scalp and face while a 2-day treatment course with the 0.05% gel is recommended for the trunk and extremities. Treatment with the 0.015% gel was found to completely clear 57% of AK while the 0.05% gel had a 34% clearance rate. Advantages of ingenol mebutate treatment include the short duration of therapy and a low recurrence rate. Local skin reactions including pain itching and redness can be expected during treatment with ingenol mebutate. This treatment was derived from the petty spurge Euphorbia peplus which has been used as a traditional remedy for keratosis.Diclofenac sodium gelTopical diclofenac sodium gel is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is thought to work in the treatment of AK through its inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway thereby limiting the production of prostaglandins which are thought to be involved in the development of UVB-induced skin cancers. Recommended duration of therapy is 60 to 90 days with twice daily application. Treatment of facial AK with diclofenac gel led to complete lesion resolution in 40% of cases. Common side effects include dryness itching redness and rash at the site of application.RetinoidsTopical retinoids have been studied in the treatment of AK with modest results and the American Academy of Dermatology does not currently recommend this as first-line therapy. Treatment with adapalene gel daily for 4 weeks and then twice daily thereafter for a total of nine months led to a significant but modest reduction in the number AKs compared to placebo; it demonstrated the additional advantage of improving the appearance of photodamaged skin.Topical tretinoin is ineffective as treatment for reducing the number of AKs. For secondary prevention of AK systemic low-dose acitretin was found to be safe well tolerated and moderately effective in chemoprophylaxis for skin cancers in kidney transplant patients.  Acitretin is a viable treatment option for organ transplant patients according to expert opinion.TirbanibulinTirbanibulin (Klisyri) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2020 for the treatment of actinic keratosis on the face or scalp.ProceduresCryotherapyLiquid nitrogen (−195.8 °C) is the most commonly used destructive therapy for the treatment of AK in the United States. It is a well-tolerated office procedure that does not require anesthesia.Cryotherapy is particularly indicated for cases where there are fewer than 15 thin well-demarcated lesions. Caution is encouraged for thicker more hyperkeratotic lesions as dysplastic cells may evade treatment.  Treatment with both cryotherapy and field treatment can be considered for these more advanced lesions.  Cryotherapy is generally performed using an open-spray technique wherein the AK is sprayed for several seconds.The process can be repeated multiple times in one office visit as tolerated. Cure rates from 67 to 99 percent have been reported depending on freeze time and lesion characteristics. Disadvantages include discomfort during and after the procedure; blistering scarring and redness; hypo- or hyperpigmentation; and destruction of healthy tissue.Photodynamic therapyAKs are one of the most common dermatologic lesions for which photodynamic therapy including topical methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is indicated.Treatment begins with preparation of the lesion which includes scraping away scales and crusts using a dermal curette. A thick layer of topical MAL or 5-ALA cream is applied to the lesion and a small area surrounding the lesion which is then covered with an occlusive dressing and left for a period of time. During this time the photosensitizer accumulates in the target cells within the AK lesion. The dressings are then removed and the lesion is treated with light at a specified wavelength.Multiple treatment regimens using different photosensitizers incubation times light sources and pretreatment regimens have been studied and suggest that longer incubation times lead to higher rates of lesion clearance. Photodynamic therapy is gaining in popularity. It has been found to have a 14% higher likelihood of achieving complete lesion clearance at 3 months compared to cryotherapy and seems to result in superior cosmetic outcomes when compared to cryotherapy or 5-FU treatment. Photodynamic therapy can be particularly effective in treating areas with multiple AK lesions.Surgical techniquesSurgical excision: Excision should be reserved for cases when the AK is a thick horny papule or when deeper invasion is suspected and histopathologic diagnosis is necessary. It is a rarely utilized technique for AK treatment.Shave excision and curettage (sometimes followed by electrodesiccation when deemed appropriate by the physician): This technique is often used for treatment of AKs and particularly for lesions appearing more similar to squamous cell carcinoma or those that are unresponsive to other treatments. The surface of the lesion can be scraped away using a scalpel or the base can be removed with a curette. Tissue can be evaluated histopathologically under the microscope but specimens acquired using this technique are not often adequate to determine whether a lesion is invasive or intraepidermal.Dermabrasion: Dermabrasion is useful in the treatment of large areas with multiple AK lesions. The process involves using a hand-held instrument to ""sand"" the skin removing the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis. Diamond fraises or wire brushes revolving at high speeds are used. The procedure can be quite painful and requires procedural sedation and anesthetic necessitating a hospital stay. One-year clearance rates with dermabrasion treatment are as high as 96% but diminish drastically to 54% at five years.Laser therapyLaser therapy using carbon dioxide (CO2) or erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) lasers is a treatment approach being utilized with increased frequency and sometimes in conjunction with computer scanning technology. Laser therapy has not been extensively studied but current evidence suggests it may be effective in cases involving multiple AKs refractive to medical therapy or AKs located in cosmetically sensitive locations such as the face.  The CO2 laser has been recommended for extensive actinic cheilitis that has not responded to 5-FU.Chemical peelsA chemical peel is a topically applied agent that wounds the outermost layer of the skin promoting organized repair exfoliation and eventually the development of smooth and rejuvenated skin. Multiple therapies have been studied. A medium-depth peel may effectively treat multiple non-hyperkeratotic AKs. It can be achieved with 35% to 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) alone or at 35% in combination with Jessners solution in a once-daily application for a minimum of 3 weeks; 70% glycolic acid (α-hydroxy acid); or solid CO2. When compared to treatment with 5-FU chemical peels have demonstrated similar efficacy and increased ease of use with similar morbidity. Chemical peels must be performed in a controlled clinic environment and are recommended only for individuals who are able to comply with follow-up precautions including avoidance of sun exposure. Furthermore they should be avoided in individuals with a history of HSV infection or keloids and in those who are immunosuppressed or who are taking photosensitizing medications.PrognosisUntreated AKs follow one of three paths: they can either persist as AKs regress or progress to invasive skin cancer as AK lesions are considered to be on the same continuum with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). AK lesions that regress also have the potential to recur.Progression: The overall risk of an AK turning into invasive cancer is low. In average-risk individuals likelihood of an AK lesion progressing to SCC is less than 1% per year. Despite this low rate of progression studies suggest that a full 60% of SCCs arise from pre-existing AKs reinforcing the idea that these lesions are closely related.Regression: Reported regression rates for single AK lesions have ranged between 15 and 63% after one year.Recurrence: Recurrence rates after 1 year for single AK lesions that have regressed range between 15 and 53%.Clinical courseGiven the aforementioned differering clinical outcomes it is difficult to predict the clinical course of any given actinic keratosis.  AK lesions may also come and go—in a cycle of appearing on the skin remaining for months and then disappearing. Often they will reappear in a few weeks or months particularly after unprotected sun exposure. Left untreated there is a chance that the lesion will advance to become invasive.  Although it is difficult to predict whether an AK will advance to become squamous cell carcinoma it has been noted that squamous cell carcinomas originate in lesions formerly diagnosed as AKs with frequencies reported between 65 and 97%.EpidemiologyActinic keratosis is very common with an estimated 14% of dermatology visits related to AKs. It is seen more often in fair-skinned individuals and rates vary with geographical location and age. Other factors such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation certain phenotypic features and immunosuppression can also contribute to the development of AKs.Men are more likely to develop AK than women and the risk of developing AK lesions increases with age. These findings have been observed in multiple studies with numbers from one study suggesting that approximately 5% of women ages 20–29 develop AK compared to 68% of women ages 60–69 and 10% of men ages 20–29 develop AK compared to 79% of men ages 60–69.Geography seems to play a role in the sense that individuals living in locations where they are exposed to more UV radiation throughout their lifetime have a significantly higher risk of developing AK. Much of the literature on AK comes from Australia where the prevalence of AK is estimated at 40–50% in adults over 40 as compared to the United States and Europe where prevalence is estimated at under 11–38% in adults. One study found that those who immigrated to Australia after age 20 had fewer AKs than native Australians in all age groups.ResearchDiagnostically researchers are investigating the role of novel biomarkers to assist in determining which AKs are more likely to develop into cutaneous or metastatic SCC. Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is seen in many different types of cancers and the expression and production of MMP-7 in particular has been found to be elevated in SCC specifically. The role of serin peptidase inhibitors (Serpins) is also being investigated. SerpinA1 was found to be elevated in the keratinocytes of SCC cell lines and SerpinA1 upregulation was correlated with SCC tumor progression in vivo. Further investigation into specific biomarkers could help providers better assess prognosis and determine best treatment approaches for particular lesions.In terms of treatment a number of medications are being studied. Resiquimod is a TLR 7/8 agonist that works similarly to imiquimod but is 10 to 100 times more potent; when used to treat AK lesions complete response rates have range from 40 to 74%. Afamelanotide is a drug that induces the production of melanin by melanocytes to act as a protective factor against UVB radiation. It is being studied to determine its efficacy in preventing AKs in organ transplant patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as gefitinib and anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab are used in the treatment of various types of cancers and are currently being investigated for potential use in the treatment and prevention of AKs.See alsoAge spotFreckleLentigoSquamous cell carcinomaList of cutaneous conditionsReferences== External links =="
3,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by impaired cortisol synthesis. It results from the deficiency of one of the five enzymes required for the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal cortex. Most of these disorders involve excessive or deficient production of hormones such as glucocorticoids mineralocorticoids or sex steroids and can alter development of primary or secondary sex characteristics in some affected infants children or adults. It is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in humans.TypesCAH can occur in various forms. The clinical presentation of each form is different and depends to a large extent on the underlying enzyme defect its precursor retention and deficient products. Classical forms appear in infancy and nonclassical forms appear in late childhood. The presentation in patients with classic CAH can be further subdivided into two forms: salt-wasting and simple-virilizing depending on whether mineralocorticoid deficiency presents or absents respectively (you should put absents before presents to straight the meaning of respectively). This subtyping is often not clinically meaningful though because all patients lose salt to some degree and clinical presentations may overlap.ClassicSalt-wastingIn 75% of cases of severe enzyme deficiency insufficient aldosterone production can lead to salt wasting failure to thrive and potentially fatal hypovolemia and shock. A missed diagnosis of salt-loss CAH is related to the increased risk of early neonatal morbidity and death.Simple-virilizingThe main feature of CAH in newborn females is the abnormal development of the external genitalia which has varying degrees of virilization. According to clinical practice guidelines for newborns found to have bilateral inaccessible gonads CAH evaluation should be considered. If virilizing CAH cannot be identified and treated both boys and girls may undergo rapid postnatal growth and virilization.NonclassicIn addition to the salt-wasting and simple-virilizing forms of CAH diagnosed in infancy  a mild or ""nonclassic"" form exists which is characterized by varying degrees of postnatal androgen excess but is sometimes asymptomatic. The nonclassic form may be noticed in late childhood and may lead to accelerated growth premature sexual maturation acne and secondary polycystic ovary syndrome. In adult males early balding and infertility may suggest the diagnosis. The nonclassic form is characterized by mild subclinical impairment of cortisol synthesis; serum cortisol concentration is usually normal.Signs and symptomsThe symptoms of CAH vary depending upon the form of CAH and the sex of the patient. Symptoms can include:Due to inadequate mineralocorticoids:Vomiting due to salt-wasting leading to dehydration and deathDue to excess androgens:In extreme virilization an elongated clitoris with a phallic-like structure is seen.Ambiguous genitalia in some infants occurs such that initially identifying  external genitalia as ""male"" or ""female"" is difficult.Early pubic hair and rapid growth occurs in childhood.Precocious puberty or failure of puberty to occur (sexual infantilism: absent or delayed puberty)Excessive facial hair virilization and/or menstrual irregularity in adolescenceInfertility due to anovulationClitoromegaly enlarged clitoris and shallow vaginaDue to insufficient androgens and estrogens:Undervirilization in XY males can result in apparently female external genitalia.In females hypogonadism can cause sexual infantilism or abnormal pubertal development infertility and other reproductive system abnormalities.GeneticsCAH results from mutations of genes for enzymes mediating the biochemical steps of production of mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids or sex steroids from cholesterol by the adrenal glands (steroidogenesis).Each form of CAH is associated with a specific defective gene. The most common type (95% of cases) involves the gene for 21-hydroxylase which is found on 6p21.3 as part of the HLA complex; 21-hydroxylase deficiency results from a unique mutation with two highly homologous near-copies in series consisting of an active gene (CYP21A2) and an inactive pseudogene (CYP21A1P). Mutant alleles result from recombination between the active and pseudogenes (gene conversion). About 5% of cases of CAH are due to defects in the gene encoding 11β-hydroxylase and consequent 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. Other more rare forms of CAH are caused by mutations in genes including HSD3B2 (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2) CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/1720-lyase) CYP11A1 (P450scc; cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) STAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; StAR) CYB5A (cytochrome b5) and CYPOR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; POR).ExpressivityFurther variability is introduced by the degree of enzyme inefficiency produced by the specific alleles each patient has. Some alleles result in more severe degrees of enzyme inefficiency. In general severe degrees of inefficiency produce changes in the fetus and problems in prenatal or perinatal life. Milder degrees of inefficiency are usually associated with excessive or deficient sex hormone effects in childhood or adolescence while the mildest forms of CAH interfere with ovulation and fertility in adults.DiagnosisClinical evaluationFemale infants with classic CAH have ambiguous genitalia due to exposure to high concentrations of androgens in utero. CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in genotypically normal female infants (46XX). Less severely affected females may present with early pubarche. Young women may present with symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (oligomenorrhea polycystic ovaries hirsutism).Males with classic CAH generally have no signs of CAH at birth. Some may present with hyperpigmentation due to co-secretion with melanocyte-stimulating hormone and possible penile enlargement. Age of diagnosis of males with CAH varies and depends on the severity of aldosterone deficiency. Boys with salt-wasting disease present early with symptoms of hyponatremia and hypovolemia. Boys with non-salt-wasting disease present later with signs of virilization.In rarer forms of CAH males are undermasculinized  and females generally have no signs or symptoms at birth.Laboratory studiesGenetic analysis can be helpful to confirm a diagnosis of CAH but it is not necessary if classic clinical and laboratory findings are present.In classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency laboratory studies will show:Hypoglycemia (due to hypocortisolism) - One of cortisols many functions is to increase blood glucose levels. This occurs via a combination of several mechanisms including (a) the stimulation of gluconeogesis (i.e. the creation of new glucose) in the liver (b) the promotion of glycogenolysis (i.e. the breakdown of glycogen into glucose) and (c) the prevention of glucose leaving the bloodstream via the downregulation of GLUT-4 receptors (which normally promote movement of glucose from the bloodstream into adipose and muscle tissues). Therefore when cortisol is deficient these processes (effectively) occur in the reverse direction. Although there are compensatory mechanisms that mitigate the impact of hypocortisolism they are limited in their extent and the net effect is still hypoglycemia.Hyponatremia (due to hypoaldosteronism) - Aldosterone is the end product of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood pressure via blood pressure surveillance in the Kidney Juxtaglomerular apparatus. Aldosterone normally functions to increase sodium retention (which brings water as well) in exchange for potassium. Thus lack of aldosterone causes hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. In fact this is a distinguishing point from 11-hydroxylase deficiency in which one of the increased products is 11-deoxycorticosterone that has weak mineralocorticoid activity. In 11-hydroxylase deficiency 11-deoxycorticosterone is produced in such excess that it acts to retain sodium at the expense of potassium. It is this reason that patients with 11-hydroxylase deficiency do not show salt wasting (although sometimes they do in infancy) and instead have hypertension/water retention and sometimes hypokalemia.Hyperkalemia (due to hypoaldosteronism)Elevated 17α-hydroxyprogesteroneClassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency typically causes 17α-hydroxyprogesterone blood levels >242 nmol/L. (For comparison a full-term infant at three days of age should have <3 nmol/L. Many neonatal screening programs have specific reference ranges by weight and gestational age because high levels may be seen in premature infants without CAH.) Salt-wasting patients tend to have higher 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels than non-salt-wasting patients. In mild cases 17α-hydroxyprogesterone may not be elevated in a particular random blood sample but it will rise during a corticotropin stimulation test.ClassificationCortisol is an adrenal steroid hormone required for normal endocrine function. Production begins in the second month of fetal life. Poor cortisol production is a hallmark of most forms of CAH. Inefficient cortisol production results in rising levels of ACTH because cortisol feeds back to inhibit ACTH production so loss of cortisol results in increased ACTH. This increased ACTH stimulation induces overgrowth (hyperplasia) and overactivity of the steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex. The defects causing adrenal hyperplasia are congenital (i.e. present at birth).Cortisol deficiency in CAH is usually partial and not the most serious problem for an affected person. Synthesis of cortisol shares steps with synthesis of mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone androgens such as testosterone and estrogens such as estradiol. The resulting excessive or deficient production of these three classes of hormones produce the most important problems for people with CAH. Specific enzyme inefficiencies are associated with characteristic patterns of over- or underproduction of mineralocorticoids or sex steroids.Since the 1960s most endocrinologists have referred to the forms of CAH by the traditional names in the left column which generally correspond to the deficient enzyme activity. As exact structures and genes for the enzymes were identified in the 1980s most of the enzymes were found to be cytochrome P450 oxidases and were renamed to reflect this. In some cases more than one enzyme was found to participate in a reaction and in other cases a single enzyme mediated in more than one reaction. Variation in different tissues and mammalian species also was found.In all its forms congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for about 95% of diagnosed cases of CAH. Unless another specific enzyme is mentioned ""CAH"" in nearly all contexts refers to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. (The terms ""salt-wasting CAH"" and ""simple virilizing CAH"" usually refer to subtypes of this condition.) CAH due to deficiencies of enzymes other than 21-hydroxylase present many of the same management challenges as 21-hydroxylase deficiency but some involve mineralocorticoid excess or sex steroid deficiency.ScreeningCurrently in the United States and over 40 other countries every child born is screened for 21-hydroxylase CAH at birth. This test  detects elevated levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). Detecting high levels of 17-OHP enables early detection of CAH. Newborns detected early enough can be placed on medication and live  relatively normal lives.The screening process however is characterized by a high false-positive rate. In one study CAH screening had the lowest positive predictive value (111 true-positive cases among 20647 abnormal screening results in a 2-year period or 0.53% compared with 6.36% for biotinidase deficiency 1.84% for congenital hypo-thyroidism 0.56% for classic galactosemia and 2.9% for phenylketonuria). According to this estimate 200 unaffected newborns required clinical and laboratory follow-up for every true case of CAH.In 2020 Wael AbdAlmageed from USC Information Sciences Institute and Mimi Kim from USC Keck School Of Medicine led a joint study in which they used deep learning technology to analyze the facial morphology and features of CAH patients compared to control. In this cross-sectional study  of 102 patients with CAH and 144 control participants deep learning methods achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92% for predicting CAH from facial images. Facial features distinguished patients with CAH from controls and analyses of facial regions found that the nose and upper face were most contributory. The findings suggest that facial morphologic features as analyzed by deep neural network techniques can be used as a phenotypic biomarker to predict CAH.TreatmentSince the clinical manifestations of each form of CAH are unique and depend to a large extent on the underlying enzyme defects their precursor retention and defective products the therapeutic goal of CAH is to replenish insufficient adrenal hormones and suppress excess of precursors.Treatment of all forms of CAH may include any of:Supplying enough glucocorticoid to reduce hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens or mineralocorticoidsProviding replacement mineralocorticoid and extra salt if the person is deficientProviding replacement testosterone or estrogens at puberty if the person is deficientAdditional treatments to optimize growth by delaying puberty or delaying bone maturationIf CAH is caused by the deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme then treatment aims to normalize levels of main substrate of the enzyme - 17α-hydroxyprogesterone.EpidemiologyThe incidence varies ethnically. In the United States congenital adrenal hyperplasia in its classic form is particularly common in Native Americans and Yupik Inuit (incidence 1⁄280). Among American Caucasians the incidence of the classic form is about 1⁄15000).Continued treatment and wellness are enhanced by education and follow up.HistoryBefore 20th centuryAn Italian anatomist Luigi De Crecchio (1832-1894) provided the earliest known description of a case of probable CAH.I propose in this narrative that it is sometimes extremely difficult and even impossible to determine sex during life. In one of the anatomical theaters of the hospital... there arrived toward the end of January a cadaver which in life was the body of a certain Joseph Marzo... The general physiognomy was decidedly male in all respects. There were no feminine curves to the body. There was a heavy beard. There was some delicacy of structure with muscles that were not very well developed... The distribution of pubic hair was typical of the male. Perhaps the lower extremities were somewhat delicate resembling the female and were covered with hair... The penis was curved posteriorly and measured 6 cm or with stretching 10 cm. The corona was 3 cm long and 8 cm in circumference. There was an ample prepuce. There was a first grade hypospadias... There were two folds of skin coming from the top of the penis and encircling it on either side. These were somewhat loose and resembled labia majora.De Crecchio then described the internal organs which included a normal vagina uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries.It was of the greatest importance to determine the habits tendencies passions and general character of this individual... I was determined to get as complete a story as possible determined to get at the base of the facts and to avoid undue exaggeration which was rampant in the conversation of many of the people present at the time of the dissection.He interviewed many people and satisfied himself that Joseph Marzo ""conducted himself within the sexual area exclusively as a male"" even to the point of contracting the ""French disease"" on two occasions. The cause of death was another in a series of episodes of vomiting and diarrhea.This account was translated by Alfred Bongiovanni from De Crecchio (""Sopra un caso di apparenzi virili in una donna"". Morgagni 7:154–188 1865) in 1963 for an article in The New England Journal of Medicine.20th and 21st centuriesThe association of excessive sex steroid effects with diseases of the adrenal cortex have been recognized for over a century. The term ""adrenogenital syndrome"" was applied to both sex-steroid producing tumors and severe forms of CAH for much of the 20th century before some of the forms of CAH were understood. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia which also dates to the first half of the century has become the preferred term to reduce ambiguity and to emphasize the underlying pathophysiology of the disorders.Much modern understanding and treatment of CAH comes from research conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore in the middle of the 20th century. Lawson Wilkins ""founder"" of pediatric endocrinology worked out the apparently paradoxical pathophysiology: that hyperplasia and overproduction of adrenal androgens resulted from impaired capacity for making cortisol. He reported use of adrenal cortical extracts to treat children with CAH in 1950. Genital reconstructive surgery was also pioneered at Hopkins. After application of karyotyping to CAH and other intersex disorders in the 1950s John Money JL Hampson and JG Hampson persuaded both the scientific community and the public that sex assignment should not be based on any single biological criterion and gender identity was largely learned and has no simple relationship with chromosomes or hormones. See Intersex for a fuller history including recent controversies over reconstructive surgery.Hydrocortisone fludrocortisone and prednisone were available by the late 1950s. By 1980 all of the relevant steroids could be measured in blood by reference laboratories for patient care. By 1990 nearly all specific genes and enzymes had been identified. The last decade though has seen a number of new developments discussed more extensively in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency:Debate over the value of genital reconstructive surgery and changing standardsDebate over sex assignment of severely virilized XX infantsNew treatments to improve height outcomesNewborn screening programs to detect CAH at birthIncreasing attempts to treat CAH before birthSociety and culturePeople with CAHNotable people with CAH include:Jeff Cagandahan is a Filipino who successfully appealed for a change of name and gender on his birth certificate.Lisa Lee DarkBetsy DriverCasimir Pulaski hypothesized based on examination of remainsSee alsoDisorders of sex developmentInborn errors of steroid metabolismIntersexList of vaginal anomalies5α-Reductase 2 deficiencyAndrogen insensitivity syndromeReferencesFurther readingHan Thang S.; Walker Brian R.; Arlt Wiebke; Ross Richard J.

4,"Adrenocortical carcinoma  (ACC) is an aggressive cancer originating in the cortex (steroid hormone-producing tissue) of the adrenal gland.Adrenocortical carcinoma is remarkable for the many hormonal syndromes that can occur in patients with steroid hormone-producing (""functional"") tumors including Cushings syndrome Conn syndrome virilization and feminization. Adrenocortical carcinoma has often invaded nearby tissues or metastasized to distant organs at the time of diagnosis and the overall 5-year survival rate is about 50%.Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumor with incidence of one to two per million population annually. It has a bimodal distribution by age with cases clustering in children under 5 and in adults 30–40 years old. The widely used angiotensin-II-responsive steroid-producing cell line H295R was originally isolated from a tumor diagnosed as adrenocortical carcinoma.Signs and symptomsAdrenocortical carcinoma may present differently in children and adults. Most tumors in children are functional and virilization is by far the most common presenting symptom(s) followed by Cushings syndrome and precocious puberty. Among adults presenting with hormonal syndromes Cushings syndrome alone is most common followed by mixed Cushings and virilization (glucocorticoid and androgen overproduction). Feminization and Conn syndrome (mineralocorticoid excess) occur in less than 10% of cases. Rarely pheochromocytoma-like hypersecretion of catecholamines has been reported in adrenocortical cancers. Nonfunctional tumors (about 40% authorities vary) usually present with abdominal or flank pain varicocele and renal vein thrombosis or they may be asymptomatic and detected incidentally.All patients with suspected ACC should be carefully evaluated for signs and symptoms of hormonal syndromes. For Cushings syndrome (glucocorticoid excess) these include weight gain muscle wasting purple lines on the abdomen a fatty ""buffalo hump"" on the neck a ""moon-like"" face and thinning fragile skin. Virilism (androgen excess) is most obvious in women and may produce excess facial and body hair acne enlargement of the clitoris deepening of the voice coarsening of facial features cessation of menstruation. Conn syndrome (mineralcorticoid excess) is marked by high blood pressure which can result in headache and hypokalemia (low serum potassium which can in turn produce muscle weakness confusion and palpitations) low plasma renin activity and high serum aldosterone. Feminization (estrogen excess) is most readily noted in men and includes breast enlargement decreased libido and impotence.PathophysiologyThe main etiologic factor of ACC is unknown although families with Li–Fraumeni syndrome caused by an inherited inactivation mutation in TP53 have increased risk. Several genes have been shown to be recurrently mutated including TP53 CTNNB1 MEN1 PRKAR1A RPL22 and DAXX. The telomerase gene TERT is often amplified while ZNRF3 and CDKN2A  are often homozygously deleted. The genes h19 insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and p57kip2 are important for fetal growth and development. They are located on chromosome 11p. Expression of the h19 gene is markedly reduced in both nonfunctioning and functioning adrenal cortical carcinomas especially in tumors producing cortisol and aldosterone. Also a loss occurs of activity of the p57kip2 gene product in virilizing adenomas and adrenal cortical carcinomas. In contrast IGF-II gene expression has been shown to be high in adrenal cortical carcinomas. Finally c-myc gene expression is relatively high in neoplasms and it is often linked to poor prognosis.Bilateral adrenocortical tumors are less common than unilateral. The majority of bilateral tumours can be distinguished according to size and aspect of the nodules: primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease which can be sporadic or part of Carney complex and primary bilateral macro nodular adrenal hyperplasia.Metastasis is most commonly to the liver and lung.DiagnosisLaboratory findingsHormonal syndromes should be confirmed with laboratory testing. Laboratory findings in Cushing syndrome include increased serum glucose (blood sugar) and increased urine cortisol. Adrenal virilism is confirmed by the finding of an excess of serum androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone. Findings in Conn syndrome include low serum potassium low plasma renin activity and high serum aldosterone. Feminization is confirmed with the finding of excess serum estrogen.ImagingRadiological studies of the abdomen such as CT scans  and magnetic resonance imaging are useful for identifying the site of the tumor differentiating it from other diseases such as adrenocortical adenoma and determining the extent of invasion of the tumor into surrounding organs and tissues. On CT it shows heterogeneous appearance due to necrosis calcifications and haemorrhage. After contrast injection it shows peripheral enhancement. Invasion of adjacent structures such as kidney vena cava liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are also common.On MRI it shows low intensity on T1-weighted images and high T2 signal with strong heterogeneous contrast enhancement and slow washout. Haemorrhagic areas may show high T1-signal.PathologyAdrenal tumors are often not biopsied prior to surgery so diagnosis is confirmed on examination of the surgical specimen by a pathologist. Grossly ACCs are often large with a tan-yellow cut surface and areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. On microscopic examination the tumor usually displays sheets of atypical cells with some resemblance to the cells of the normal adrenal cortex. The presence of invasion and mitotic activity help differentiate small cancers from adrenocortical adenomas.Several relatively rare variants of ACC include:Oncocytic adrenal cortical carcinomaMyxoid adrenal cortical carcinomaCarcinosarcomaAdenosquamous adrenocortical carcinomaClear cell adrenal cortical carcinomaDifferential diagnosisDifferential diagnosis includes:Adrenocortical adenomaRenal cell carcinomaPheochromocytomaHepatocellular carcinomaAdrenocortical carcinomas are most commonly distinguished from adrenocortical adenomas (their benign counterparts) by the Weiss system as follows:Total score indicates:0-2: Adrenocortical adenoma3: Undetermined4-9: Adrenocortical carcinomaTreatmentThe only curative treatment is complete surgical excision of the tumor which can be performed even in the case of invasion into large blood vessels such as the renal vein or inferior vena cava. The 5-year survival rate after successful surgery is 50–60% but unfortunately many patients are not surgical candidates. Radiation therapy and radiofrequency ablation may be used for palliation in patients who are not surgical candidates.  Minimally invasive surgical techniques remain controversial due to the absence of long-term data with a particular concern for rates of recurrence and peritoneal carcinomatosis.Chemotherapy regimens typically include the drug mitotane an inhibitor of steroid synthesis which is toxic to cells of the adrenal cortex as well as standard cytotoxic drugs. A retrospective analysis showed a survival benefit for mitotane in addition to surgery when compared to surgery alone.The two most common regimens are cisplatin doxorubicin etoposide (EDP) + mitotane and streptozotocin + mitotane. The FIRM-ACT trial demonstrated higher rates of response and longer progression-free survival with EDP + mitotane than with streptozotocin + mitotane.PrognosisACC generally carries a poor prognosis with an overall 5-year survival rate of about 50%. Five-year disease-free survival for a complete resection of a stage I–III ACC is about 30%. The most important prognostic factors are age of the patient and stage of the tumor. Poor prognostic factors include mitotic activity venous invasion weight of 50 g or more diameter of 6.5 cm or more Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index of 4% or more and p53 positive.In its malignancy adrenocortical carcinoma is unlike most tumours of the adrenal cortex which are benign (adenomas) and only occasionally cause Cushings syndrome.References== External links =="
5,"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a set of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in alcohol use after a period of excessive use. Symptoms typically include anxiety shakiness sweating vomiting fast heart rate and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures hallucinations and delirium tremens (DTs). Symptoms typically begin around six hours following the last drink are worst at 24 to 72 hours and improve by seven days.Alcohol withdrawal may occur in those who are alcohol dependent. This may occur following a planned or unplanned decrease in alcohol intake. The underlying mechanism involves a decreased responsiveness of GABA receptors in the brain. The withdrawal process is typically followed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale (CIWA-Ar).The typical treatment of alcohol withdrawal is with benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam. Often the amounts given are based on a persons symptoms. Thiamine is recommended routinely. Electrolyte problems and low blood sugar should also be treated. Early treatment improves outcomes.In the Western world about 15% of people have problems with alcoholism at some point in time. Alcohol depresses the central nervous system slowing cerebral messaging and altering the way signals are sent and received. Progressively larger amounts of alcohol are needed to achieve the same physical and emotional results. The drinker eventually must consume alcohol just to avoid the physical cravings and withdrawal symptoms. About half of people with alcoholism will develop withdrawal symptoms upon reducing their use with four percent developing severe symptoms. Among those with severe symptoms up to 15% die. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal have been described at least as early as 400 BC by Hippocrates. It is not believed to have become a widespread problem until the 1700s.Signs and symptomsSigns and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur primarily in the central nervous system. The severity of withdrawal can vary from mild symptoms such as insomnia trembling and anxiety to severe and life-threatening symptoms such as alcoholic hallucinosis delirium tremens and autonomic instability.Withdrawal usually begins 6 to 24 hours after the last drink. It can last for up to one week. To be classified as alcohol withdrawal syndrome patients must exhibit at least two of the following symptoms: increased hand tremor insomnia nausea or vomiting transient hallucinations (auditory visual or tactile) psychomotor agitation anxiety generalized tonic–clonic seizures and autonomic instability.The severity of symptoms is dictated by a number of factors the most important of which are degree of alcohol intake length of time the individual has been using alcohol and previous history of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms are also grouped together and classified:Alcohol hallucinosis: patients have transient visual auditory or tactile hallucinations but are otherwise clear.Withdrawal seizures: seizures occur within 48 hours of alcohol cessations and occur either as a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure or as a brief episode of multiple seizures.Delirium tremens: hyperadrenergic state disorientation tremors diaphoresis impaired attention/consciousness and visual and auditory hallucinations.ProgressionSix to 12 hours after the ingestion of the last drink withdrawal symptoms such as shaking headache sweating anxiety nausea or vomiting may occur. Twelve to 24 hours after cessation the condition may progress to such major symptoms as confusion hallucinations (with awareness of reality) while less severe symptoms may persist and develop including tremor agitation hyperactivity and insomnia.At 12 to 48 hours following the last ethanol ingestion the possibility of generalized tonic–clonic seizures should be anticipated occurring in 3-5% of cases. Meanwhile none of the earlier withdrawal symptoms will typically have abated. Seizures carry the risk of major complications and death for the alcoholic.Although the persons condition usually begins to improve after 48 hours withdrawal symptoms sometimes continue to increase in severity and advance to the most severe stage of withdrawal delirium tremens. This occurs in 5 to 20% of patients experiencing detoxification and one third of untreated cases which is characterized by hallucinations that are indistinguishable from reality severe confusion seizures high blood pressure and fever that can persist anywhere from 4 to 12 days.Protracted withdrawalA protracted alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in many alcoholics when withdrawal symptoms continue beyond the acute withdrawal stage but usually at a subacute level of intensity and gradually decreasing with severity over time. This syndrome is sometimes referred to as the post-acute-withdrawal syndrome. Some withdrawal symptoms can linger for at least a year after discontinuation of alcohol. Symptoms can include a craving for alcohol inability to feel pleasure from normally pleasurable things (known as anhedonia) clouding of sensorium disorientation nausea and vomiting or headache.Insomnia is a common protracted withdrawal symptom that persists after the acute withdrawal phase of alcohol. Insomnia has also been found to influence relapse rate. Studies have found that magnesium or trazodone can help treat the persisting withdrawal symptom of insomnia in recovering alcoholics. Insomnia can be difficult to treat in these individuals because many of the traditional sleep aids (e.g. benzodiazepine receptor agonists and barbiturate receptor agonists) work via a GABAA receptor mechanism and are cross-tolerant with alcohol. However trazodone is not cross-tolerant with alcohol. The acute phase of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome can occasionally be protracted. Protracted delirium tremens has been reported in the medical literature as a possible but unusual feature of alcohol withdrawal.PathophysiologyChronic use of alcohol leads to changes in brain chemistry especially in the GABAergic system. Various adaptations occur such as changes in gene expression and down regulation of GABAA receptors. During acute alcohol withdrawal changes also occur such as upregulation of alpha4 containing GABAA receptors and downregulation of alpha1 and alpha3 containing GABAA receptors. Neurochemical changes occurring during alcohol withdrawal can be minimized with drugs which are used for acute detoxification. With abstinence from alcohol and cross-tolerant drugs these changes in neurochemistry may gradually return towards normal. Adaptations to the NMDA system also occur as a result of repeated alcohol intoxication and are involved in the hyper-excitability of the central nervous system during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Homocysteine levels which are elevated during chronic drinking increase even further during the withdrawal state and may result in excitotoxicity. Alterations in ECG (in particular an increase in QT interval) and EEG abnormalities (including abnormal quantified EEG) may occur during early withdrawal. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and increased release of corticotropin-releasing hormone occur during both acute as well as protracted abstinence from alcohol and contribute to both acute and protracted withdrawal symptoms. Anhedonia/dysphoria symptoms which can persist as part of a protracted withdrawal may be due to dopamine underactivity.KindlingKindling is a phenomenon where repeated alcohol detoxifications leads to an increased severity of the withdrawal syndrome. For example binge drinkers may initially experience no withdrawal symptoms but with each period of alcohol use followed by cessation their withdrawal symptoms intensify in severity and may eventually result in full-blown delirium tremens with convulsive seizures. Alcoholics who experience seizures during detoxification are more likely to have had previous episodes of alcohol detoxification than patients who did not have seizures during withdrawal. In addition people with previous withdrawal syndromes are more likely to have more medically complicated alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Kindling can cause complications and may increase the risk of relapse alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive deficits. Chronic alcohol misuse and kindling via multiple alcohol withdrawals may lead to permanent alterations in the GABAA receptors. The mechanism behind kindling is sensitization of some neuronal systems and desensitization of other neuronal systems which leads to increasingly gross neurochemical imbalances. This in turn leads to more profound withdrawal symptoms including anxiety convulsions and neurotoxicity.Binge drinking is associated with increased impulsivity impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning. These adverse effects are believed to be due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have detoxified repeatedly but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be the most important factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.People in adolescence who experience repeated withdrawals from binge drinking show impairments of long-term nonverbal memory. Alcoholics who have had two or more alcohol withdrawals show more frontal lobe cognitive dysfunction than those who have experienced one or no prior withdrawals. Kindling of neurons is the proposed cause of withdrawal-related cognitive damage. Kindling from repeated withdrawals leads to accumulating neuroadaptive changes. Kindling may also be the reason for cognitive damage seen in binge drinkers.DiagnosisMany hospitals use the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) protocol in order to assess the level of withdrawal present and therefore the amount of medication needed. When overuse of alcohol is suspected but drinking history is unclear testing for elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin or gammaglutamyl transferase can help make the diagnosis of alcohol overuse and dependence more clear. The CIWA has also been shortened (now called the CIWA-Ar) while retaining its validity and reliability to help assess patients more efficiently due to the life-threatening nature of alcohol withdrawal.Other conditions that may present similarly include benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome (a condition also mainly caused by GABAA receptor adaptation).TreatmentBenzodiazepines  are effective for the management of symptoms as well as the prevention of seizures. Certain vitamins are also an important part of the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In those with severe symptoms inpatient care is often required. In those with lesser symptoms treatment at home may be possible with daily visits with a health care provider.BenzodiazepinesBenzodiazepines are the most commonly used medication for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and are generally safe and effective in suppressing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. This class of medication is generally effective in symptoms control but need to be used carefully. Although benzodiazepines have a long history of successfully treating and preventing withdrawal there is no consensus on the ideal one to use. The most commonly used agents are long-acting benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. These are believed to be superior to other benzodiazepines for treatment of delirium and allow for longer periods between doses. However benzodiazepines with intermediate half-lives like lorazepam may be safer in people with liver problems. Benzodiazepines showed a protective benefit against alcohol withdrawal symptoms in particular seizure compared to other common methods of treatment.The primary debate between use of long-acting benzodiazepines and short-acting is that of ease of use. Longer-acting drugs such as diazepam can be administered less frequently. However evidence does exist that ""symptom-triggered regimens"" such as those used when treating with lorazepam are as safe and effective but have decreased treatment duration and medication quantity used.Although benzodiazepines are very effective at treating alcohol withdrawal they should be carefully used. Benzodiazepines should only be used for brief periods in alcoholics who are not already dependent on them as they share cross tolerance with alcohol. There is a risk of replacing an alcohol addiction with benzodiazepine dependence or adding another addiction. Furthermore disrupted GABA benzodiazepine receptor function is part of alcohol dependence and chronic benzodiazepines may prevent full recovery from alcohol induced mental effects. The combination of benzodiazepines and alcohol can amplify the adverse psychological effects of each other causing enhanced depressive effects on mood and increase suicidal actions and are generally contraindicated except for alcohol withdrawal.VitaminsAlcoholics are often deficient in various nutrients which can cause severe complications during alcohol withdrawal such as the development of Wernicke syndrome. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome these individuals should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. During alcohol withdrawal the prophylactic administration of thiamine folic acid and pyridoxine intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a banana bag for intravenous administration.AnticonvulsantsVery limited evidence indicates that topiramate or pregabalin may be useful in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Limited evidence supports the use of gabapentin or carbamazepine for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however gabapentin does not appear to be effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting. A 2010 Cochrane review similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported. Paraldehyde combined with chloral hydrate showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and carbamazepine may have advantages for certain symptoms. Long term anticonvulsant medications are not usually recommended in those who have had prior seizures due to withdrawal.Prevention of further drinkingThere are three medications used to help prevent a return to drinking: naltrexone acamprosate and disulfiram. They are used after withdrawal has occurred.OtherClonidine may be used in combination with benzodiazepines to help some of the symptoms. No conclusions can be drawn concerning the efficacy or safety of baclofen for alcohol withdrawal syndrome due to the insufficiency and low quality of the evidence.Antipsychotics such as haloperidol are sometimes used in addition to benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis. Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal as they lower the seizure threshold. Clozapine olanzapine or low-potency phenothiazines (such as chlorpromazine) are particularly risky; if used extreme caution is required.While intravenous ethanol could theoretically be used evidence to support this use at least in those who are very sick is insufficient.PrognosisFailure to manage the alcohol withdrawal syndrome appropriately can lead to permanent brain damage or death. It has been proposed that brain damage due to alcohol withdrawal may be prevented by the administration of NMDA antagonists calcium antagonists and glucocorticoid antagonists.Substances impairing recoveryContinued use of benzodiazepines may impair recovery from psychomotor and cognitive impairments from alcohol. Cigarette smoking may slow down or interfere with recovery of brain pathways in recovering alcoholics.ReferencesExternal linksCIWA-Ar for Alcohol WithdrawalAlcohol Detox Guidelines Example Archived 19 August 2019 at the Wayback Machine"
6,"Alopecia areata also known as spot baldness is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body. Often it results in a few bald spots on the scalp each about the size of a coin. Psychological stress and illness are possible factors in bringing on alopecia areata in individuals at risk but in most cases there is no obvious trigger. People are generally otherwise healthy. In a few cases all the hair on the scalp is lost (alopecia totalis) or all body hair is lost (alopecia universalis). Hair loss can be permanent or temporary. It is distinctive from pattern hair loss which is common among males.Alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disease resulting from a breach in the immune privilege of the hair follicles. Risk factors include a family history of the condition. Among identical twins if one is affected the other has about a 50% chance of also being affected. The underlying mechanism involves failure by the body to recognize its own cells with subsequent immune-mediated destruction of the hair follicle.No cure for the condition is known. Efforts may be used to try to speed hair regrowth such as cortisone injections. Sunscreen head coverings to protect from cold and sun and glasses if the eyelashes are missing are recommended. In some cases the hair regrows and the condition does not reoccur. In others hair loss and regrowth occurs over years. Among those in whom all body hair is lost fewer than 10% recover.About 0.15% of people are affected at any one time and 2% of people are affected at some point in time. Onset is usually in childhood. Females are affected at higher rates than males.Signs and symptomsTypical first symptoms of alopecia areata are small bald patches. The underlying skin is unscarred and looks superficially normal. Although these patches can take many shapes they are usually round or oval. Alopecia areata most often affects the scalp and beard but may occur on any part of the body with hair. Different areas of the skin may exhibit hair loss and regrowth at the same time. The disease may also go into remission for a time or may be permanent. It is common in children.The area of hair loss may tingle or be mildly painful. The hair tends to fall out over a short period of time with the loss commonly occurring more on one side of the scalp than the other.Exclamation point hairs narrower along the length of the strand closer to the base producing a characteristic ""exclamation point"" appearance are often present. These hairs are very short (3–4 mm) and can be seen surrounding the bald patches.When healthy hair is pulled out at most a few should come out and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp. In cases of alopecia areata hair  tends to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the bodys immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy.Nails may have pitting or trachyonychia.CausesAlopecia areata is thought to be a systemic autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks its own anagen hair follicles and suppresses or stops hair growth. For example T cell lymphocytes cluster around affected follicles causing inflammation and subsequent hair loss. Hair follicles in a normal state are thought to be kept secure from the immune system a phenomenon called immune privilege. A breach in this immune privilege state is considered as the cause of alopecia areata. A few cases of babies being born with congenital alopecia areata have been reported.Alopecia areata is not contagious. It occurs more frequently in people who have affected family members suggesting heredity may be a factor. Strong evidence of genetic association with increased risk for alopecia areata was found by studying families with two or more affected members. This study identified at least four regions in the genome that are likely to contain these genes. In addition alopecia areata shares genetic risk factors with other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. It may be the only manifestation of celiac disease.Endogenous retinoids metabolic defect is a key part of the pathogenesis of the alopecia areata.In 2010 a genome-wide association study was completed that identified 129 single nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated with alopecia areata. The genes that were identified include those involved incontrolling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 interleukin-2 interleukin-2 receptor A and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4) as well as the human leukocyte antigen. The study also identified two genes PRDX5 and STX17 that are expressed in the hair follicle.DiagnosisAlopecia areata is usually diagnosed based on clinical features.Trichoscopy may aid in establishing the diagnosis. In alopecia areata trichoscopy shows regularly distributed ""yellow dots"" (hyperkeratotic plugs) small exclamation-mark hairs and  ""black dots"" (destroyed hairs in the hair follicle opening).Oftentimes however discrete areas of hair loss surrounded by exclamation mark hairs is sufficient for clinical diagnosis of alopecia areata. Sometimes reddening of the skin erythema may also be present in the balding area.A biopsy is rarely needed to make the diagnosis or aid in the management of alopecia areata. Histologic findings may include peribulbar lymphocytic infiltration resembling a ""swarm of bees"" a shift in the anagen-to-telogen ratio towards telogen and dilated follicular infundibulae. Other helpful findings can include pigment incontinence in the hair bulb and follicular stelae. Occasionally in inactive alopecia areata no inflammatory infiltrates are found.ClassificationCommonly alopecia areata involves hair loss in one or more round spots on the scalp.Hair may also be lost more diffusely over the whole scalp in which case the condition is called diffuse alopecia areata.Alopecia areata monolocularis describes baldness in only one spot. It may occur anywhere on the head.Alopecia areata multilocularis refers to multiple areas of hair loss.Ophiasis refers to hair loss in the shape of a wave at the circumference of the head.The disease may be limited only to the beard in which case it is called alopecia areata barbae.If the person loses all the hair on the scalp the disease is then called alopecia areata totalis.If all body hair including pubic hair is lost the diagnosis then becomes alopecia areata universalis.Alopecia areata totalis and universalis are rare.TreatmentThe objective assessment of treatment efficacy is very difficult and spontaneous remission is unpredictable but if the affected area is patched the hair may regrow spontaneously in many cases. None of the existing therapeutic options are curative or preventive.In cases of severe hair loss limited success has been achieved by using the corticosteroid medications clobetasol or fluocinonide corticosteroid injections or cream. Application of corticosteroid creams to the affected skin is less effective and takes longer to produce results. Steroid injections are commonly used in sites where the areas of hair loss on the head are small or especially where eyebrow hair has been lost. Whether they are effective is uncertain. Some other medications that have been used are minoxidil Elocon (mometasone) ointment (steroid cream) irritants (anthralin or topical coal tar) and topical immunotherapy ciclosporin sometimes in different combinations. Topical corticosteroids frequently fail to enter the skin deeply enough to affect the hair bulbs which are the treatment target and small lesions typically also regrow spontaneously. Oral corticosteroids may decrease the hair loss but only for the period during which they are taken and these medications can cause serious side effects. No one treatment is effective in all cases and some individuals may show no response to any treatment. Few treatments have been well evaluated. A 2008 meta-analysis of oral and topical corticosteroids topical ciclosporin photodynamic therapy and topical minoxidil showed no benefit of hair growth compared with placebo especially with regard to long-term benefits. For more severe cases recent studies have shown promising results with the individual use of the immunosuppressant Methotrexate or adjunct use with corticosteroids. However as relapse of the condition may occur long-term treatment is recommended.When alopecia areata is associated with celiac disease treatment with a gluten-free diet allows for complete and permanent regrowth of scalp and other body hair in many people but in others remissions and recurrences are seen. This improvement is probably due to the normalization of the immune response as a result of gluten withdrawal from the diet.In June 2022 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized baricitinib for the treatment of severe alopecia areata.PrognosisIn most cases that begin with a small number of patches of hair loss hair grows back after a few months to a year. In cases with a greater number of patches hair can either grow back or progress to alopecia areata totalis or in rare cases alopecia areata universalis.No loss of body function occurs and the effects of alopecia areata are psychological (loss of self-image due to hair loss) although these can be severe. Loss of hair also means the scalp burns more easily in the sun. Patients may also have aberrant nail formation because keratin forms both hair and nails.Hair may grow back and then fall out again later. This may not indicate a recurrence of the condition but rather a natural cycle of growth-and-shedding from a relatively synchronised start; such a pattern will fade over time. Episodes of alopecia areata before puberty predispose to chronic recurrence of the condition.Alopecia can be the cause of psychological stress. Because hair loss can lead to significant changes in appearance individuals with it may experience social phobia anxiety and depression.EpidemiologyThe condition affects 0.1%–0.2% of the population with a lifetime risk of 1%-2%. and is more common in females.Alopecia areata occurs in people who are otherwise healthy and have no other skin disorders. Initial presentation most commonly occurs in the early childhood late teenage years or young adulthood but can happen at any ages. Patients also tend to have a slightly higher incidence of conditions related to the immune system such as asthma allergies atopic dermatitis and hypothyroidism.ResearchMany medications are being studied. Some of these medications are approved for other diseases others are not available outside of studies.In 2014 preliminary findings showing that oral ruxolitinib a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis restored hair growth in three individuals with long-standing and severe disease. The medicine costs almost US$10000 a month.HistoryAlopecia areata and alopecia barbae have been identified by some as the biblical nethek condition that is part of the greater tzaraath family of skin disorders; the said disorders are purported to being discussed in the Book of Leviticus chapter 13.Notable peopleActor Anthony Carrigan athlete of American Ninja Warrior fame Kevin Bull Australian politician Peter Dutton Australian actor Alan Fletcher Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley K-pop singer Peniel Shin of BtoB and actresses Jada Pinkett Smith and May Calamawy all have some form of alopecia areata.See alsoNoncicatricial alopeciaTrichotillomaniaReferencesExternal linksNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases at NIHDermAtlas 42"
7,"Altitude sickness the mildest form being acute mountain sickness (AMS) is the harmful effect of high altitude caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation. People can respond to high altitude in different ways. Symptoms may include headaches vomiting tiredness confusion trouble sleeping and dizziness. Acute mountain sickness can progress to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) with associated shortness of breath or high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) with associated confusion. Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long-term exposure to high altitude.Altitude sickness typically occurs only above 2500 metres (8000 ft) though some are affected at lower altitudes. Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness a high degree of activity and a rapid increase in elevation. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities. It is recommended that at high altitude any symptoms of headache nausea shortness of breath or vomiting be assumed to be altitude sickness.Prevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than 300 metres (1000 ft) per day. Being physically fit does not decrease the risk. Treatment is generally by descending and sufficient fluids. Mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen acetazolamide or dexamethasone. Severe cases may benefit from oxygen therapy and a portable hyperbaric bag may be used if descent is not possible. Treatment efforts however have not been well studied.AMS occurs in about 20% of people after rapidly going to 2500 metres (8000 ft) and 40% of people going to 3000 metres (10000 ft). While AMS and HACE occurs equally frequently in males and females HAPE occurs more often in males. The earliest description of altitude sickness is attributed to a Chinese text from around 30 BCE which describes ""Big Headache Mountains"" possibly referring to the Karakoram Mountains around Kilik Pass.Signs and symptomsPeople have different susceptibilities to altitude sickness; for some otherwise healthy people acute altitude sickness can begin to appear at around 2000 metres (6600 ft) above sea level such as at many mountain ski resorts equivalent to a pressure of 80 kilopascals (0.79 atm). This is the most frequent type of altitude sickness encountered. Symptoms often manifest within ten hours of ascent and generally subside within two days though they occasionally develop into the more serious conditions. Symptoms include headache confusion fatigue stomach illness dizziness and sleep disturbance. Exertion may aggravate the symptoms.Those individuals with the lowest initial partial pressure of end-tidal pCO2 (the lowest concentration of carbon dioxide at the end of the respiratory cycle a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation) and corresponding high oxygen saturation levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high end-tidal pCO2 and low oxygen saturation levels.Primary symptomsHeadaches are the primary symptom used to diagnose altitude sickness although a headache is also a symptom of dehydration. A headache occurring at an altitude above 2400 metres (7900 ft) – a pressure of 76 kilopascals (0.75 atm) – combined with any one or more of the following symptoms may indicate altitude sickness:Severe symptomsSymptoms that may indicate life-threatening altitude sickness include:Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)Symptoms similar to bronchitisPersistent dry coughFeverShortness of breath even when restingCerebral edema (swelling of the brain)Headache that does not respond to analgesicsUnsteady gaitGradual loss of consciousnessIncreased nausea and vomitingRetinal hemorrhageThe most serious symptoms of altitude sickness arise from edema (fluid accumulation in the tissues of the body). At very high altitude humans can get either high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). The physiological cause of altitude-induced edema is not conclusively established. It is currently believed however that HACE is caused by local vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels in response to hypoxia resulting in greater blood flow and consequently greater capillary pressures. On the other hand HAPE may be due to general vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation (normally a response to regional ventilation-perfusion mismatches) which with constant or increased cardiac output also leads to increases in capillary pressures. For those with HACE dexamethasone may provide temporary relief from symptoms in order to keep descending under their own power.HAPE can progress rapidly and is often fatal. Symptoms include fatigue severe dyspnea at rest and cough that is initially dry but may progress to produce pink frothy sputum. Descent to lower altitudes alleviates the symptoms of HAPE.HACE is a life-threatening condition that can lead to coma or death. Symptoms include headache fatigue visual impairment bladder dysfunction bowel dysfunction loss of coordination paralysis on one side of the body and confusion. Descent to lower altitudes may save those affected by HACE.CauseAltitude sickness can first occur at 1500 metres (4900 ft) with the effects becoming severe at extreme altitudes (greater than 5500 metres (18000 ft)). Only brief trips above 6000 metres (20000 ft) are possible and supplemental oxygen is needed to avert sickness.As altitude increases the available amount of oxygen to sustain mental and physical alertness decreases with the overall air pressure though the relative percentage of oxygen in air at about 21% remains practically unchanged up to 21000 metres (69000 ft). The RMS velocities of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen are very similar and thus no change occurs in the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen until stratospheric heights.Dehydration due to the higher rate of water vapor lost from the lungs at higher altitudes may contribute to the symptoms of altitude sickness.The rate of ascent altitude attained amount of physical activity at high altitude as well as individual susceptibility are contributing factors to the onset and severity of high-altitude illness.Altitude sickness usually occurs following a rapid ascent and can usually be prevented by ascending slowly. In most of these cases the symptoms are temporary and usually abate as altitude acclimatization occurs. However in extreme cases altitude sickness can be fatal.High altitude illness can be classified according to the altitude: high (1500–3500 metres (4900–11500 ft)) very high (3500–5500 metres (11500–18000 ft)) and extreme (above 5500 metres (18000 ft)).High altitudeAt high altitude 1500 to 3500 metres (4900 to 11500 ft) the onset of physiological effects of diminished inspiratory oxygen pressure (PiO2) includes decreased exercise performance and increased ventilation (lower arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide: PCO2). While arterial oxygen transport may be only slightly impaired the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) generally stays above 90%. Altitude sickness is common between 2400 and 4000 metres (7900 and 13100 ft) because of the large number of people who ascend rapidly to these altitudes.Very high altitudeAt very high altitude 3500 to 5500 metres (11500 to 18000 ft) maximum SaO2 falls below 90% as the arterial PO2 falls below 60mmHg. Extreme hypoxemia may occur during exercise during sleep and in the presence of high altitude pulmonary edema or other acute lung conditions. Severe altitude illness occurs most commonly in this range.Extreme altitudeAbove 5500 metres (18000 ft) marked hypoxemia hypocapnia and alkalosis are characteristic of extreme altitudes. Progressive deterioration of physiologic function eventually outstrips acclimatization. As a result no permanent human habitation occurs above 6000 metres (20000 ft). A period of acclimatization is necessary when ascending to extreme altitude; abrupt ascent without supplemental oxygen for other than brief exposures invites severe altitude sickness.MechanismThe physiology of altitude sickness centres around the alveolar gas equation; the atmospheric pressure is low but there is still 20.9% oxygen. Water vapour still occupies the same pressure too—this means that there is less oxygen pressure available in the lungs and blood. Compare these two equations comparing the amount of oxygen in blood at altitude:The hypoxia leads to an increase in minute ventilation (hence both low CO2 and subsequently bicarbonate) Hb increases through haemoconcentration and erythrogenesis. Alkalosis shifts the haemoglobin dissociation constant to the left 23-BPG increases to counter this. Cardiac output increases through an increase in heart rate.The bodys response to high altitude includes the following:↑ Erythropoietin → ↑ hematocrit and haemoglobin↑ 23-BPG (allows ↑ release of O2 and a right shift on the Hb-O2 disassociation curve)↑ kidney excretion of bicarbonate (use of acetazolamide can augment for treatment)Chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (can cause right ventricular hypertrophy)People with high-altitude sickness generally have reduced hyperventilator response impaired gas exchange fluid retention or increased sympathetic drive. There is thought to be an increase in cerebral venous volume because of an increase in cerebral blood flow and hypocapnic cerebral vasoconstriction causing oedema.DiagnosisAltitude sickness is typically self-diagnosed since symptoms are consistent: nausea vomiting headache and can generally be deduced from a rapid change in altitude or oxygen levels. However some symptoms may be confused with dehydration. Some severe cases may require professional diagnosis which can be assisted with multiple different methods such as using an MRI or CT scan to check for abnormal buildup of fluids in the lung or brain.PreventionAscending slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness. Avoiding strenuous activity such as skiing hiking etc. in the first 24 hours at high altitude may reduce the symptoms of AMS. Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants and thus slow down the acclimatization process and should be avoided. Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS. Thus avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24–48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal.Pre-acclimatizationPre-acclimatization is when the body develops tolerance to low oxygen concentrations before ascending to an altitude. It significantly reduces risk because less time has to be spent at altitude to acclimatize in the traditional way. Additionally because less time has to be spent on the mountain less food and supplies have to be taken up. Several commercial systems exist that use altitude tents so called because they mimic altitude by reducing the percentage of oxygen in the air while keeping air pressure constant to the surroundings. Examples of pre-acclimation measures include remote ischaemic preconditioning using hypobaric air breathing in order to simulate altitude and positive end-expiratory pressure.Altitude acclimatizationAltitude acclimatization is the process of adjusting to decreasing oxygen levels at higher elevations in order to avoid altitude sickness. Once above approximately 3000 metres (10000 ft) – a pressure of 70 kilopascals (0.69 atm) – most climbers and high-altitude trekkers take the ""climb-high sleep-low"" approach. For high-altitude climbers a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a base camp climb up to a higher camp (slowly) and then return to base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay. This process is then repeated a few times each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there a process that involves the production of additional red blood cells. Once the climber has acclimatized to a given altitude the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations. The rule of thumb is to ascend no more than 300 m (1000 ft) per day to sleep. That is one can climb from 3000 m (9800 ft) (70 kPa or 0.69 atm) to 4500 m (15000 ft) (58 kPa or 0.57 atm) in one day but one should then descend back to 3300 m (10800 ft) (67.5 kPa or 0.666 atm) to sleep. This process cannot safely be rushed and this is why climbers need to spend days (or even weeks at times) acclimatizing before attempting to climb a high peak. Simulated altitude equipment such as altitude tents provide hypoxic (reduced oxygen) air and are designed to allow partial pre-acclimation to high altitude reducing the total time required on the mountain itself.Altitude acclimatization is necessary for some people who move rapidly from lower altitudes to higher altitudes .MedicationsThe drug acetazolamide (trade name Diamox) may help some people making a rapid ascent to sleeping altitude above 2700 metres (9000 ft) and it may also be effective if started early in the course of AMS. Acetazolamide can be taken before symptoms appear as a preventive measure at a dose of 125 mg twice daily. The Everest Base Camp Medical Centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations. The Centre suggests a dosage of 125 mg twice daily for prophylaxis starting from 24 hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending; with 250 mg twice daily recommended for treatment of AMS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest the same dose for prevention of 125 mg acetazolamide every 12 hours. Acetazolamide a mild diuretic works by stimulating the kidneys to secrete more bicarbonate in the urine thereby acidifying the blood. This change in pH stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration thus speeding the natural acclimatization process. An undesirable side-effect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance. Other minor side effects include a tingle-sensation in hands and feet. Although a sulfonamide; acetazolamide is a non-antibiotic and has not been shown to cause life-threatening allergic cross-reactivity in those with a self-reported sulfonamide allergy. Dosage of 1000 mg/day will produce a 25% decrease in performance on top of the reduction due to high-altitude exposure. The CDC advises that Dexamethasone be reserved for treatment of severe AMS and HACE during descents and notes that Nifedipine may prevent HAPE.There is insufficient evidence to determine the safety of sumatriptan and if it may help prevent altitude sickness. Despite their popularity antioxidant treatments have not been found to be effective medications for prevention of AMS. Interest in phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil has been limited by the possibility that these drugs might worsen the headache of mountain sickness. A promising possible preventive for altitude sickness is myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobin.Prior to the onset of altitude sickness ibuprofen is a suggested non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and painkiller that can help alleviate both the headache and nausea associated with AMS. It has not been studied for the prevention of cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) associated with extreme symptoms of AMS.Over-the-counter herbal supplements and traditional medicinesHerbal supplements and traditional medicines are sometimes suggested to prevent high altitude sickness including ginkgo biloba R crenulata minerals such as iron antacids and hormonal-based supplements such as medroxyprogesterone and erythropoietin. Medical evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of these approaches is often contradictory or lacking. Indigenous peoples of the Americas such as the Aymaras of the Altiplano have for centuries chewed coca leaves to try to alleviate the symptoms of mild altitude sickness. This therapy has not yet been proven effective in a clinical study. In Chinese and Tibetan traditional medicine an extract of the root tissue of Radix rhodiola is often taken in order to prevent the symptoms of high altitude sickness however no clear medical studies have confirmed the effectiveness or safety of this extract.Oxygen enrichmentIn high-altitude conditions oxygen enrichment can counteract the hypoxia related effects of altitude sickness. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 3400 metres (11200 ft) (67 kPa or 0.66 atm) raising the oxygen concentration level by 5% via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an effective altitude of 3000 m (10000 ft) (70 kPa or 0.69 atm) which is more tolerable for those unaccustomed to high altitudes.Oxygen from gas bottles or liquid containers can be applied directly via a nasal cannula or mask. Oxygen concentrators based upon pressure swing adsorption (PSA) VSA or vacuum-pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) can be used to generate the oxygen if electricity is available. Stationary oxygen concentrators typically use PSA technology which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes. One way to compensate for the performance degradation is to use a concentrator with more flow capacity. There are also portable oxygen concentrators that can be used on vehicular DC power or on internal batteries and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to 4000 m (13000 ft). The application of high-purity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen).Other methodsIncreased water intake may also help in acclimatization to replace the fluids lost through heavier breathing in the thin dry air found at altitude although consuming excessive quantities (""over-hydration"") has no benefits and may cause dangerous hyponatremia.TreatmentThe only reliable treatment and in many cases the only option available is to descend. Attempts to treat or stabilize the patient in situ (at altitude) are dangerous unless highly controlled and with good medical facilities. However the following treatments have been used when the patients location and circumstances permit:Oxygen may be used for mild to moderate AMS below 3700 metres (12000 ft) and is commonly provided by physicians at mountain resorts. Symptoms abate in 12 to 36 hours without the need to descend.For more serious cases of AMS or where rapid descent is impractical a Gamow bag a portable plastic hyperbaric chamber inflated with a foot pump can be used to reduce the effective altitude by as much as 1500 m (5000 ft). A Gamow bag is generally used only as an aid to evacuate severe AMS patients not to treat them at altitude.Acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily dosing assists in AMS treatment by quickening altitude acclimatization. A study by the Denali Medical Research Project concluded: ""In established cases of acute mountain sickness treatment with acetazolamide relieves symptoms improves arterial oxygenation and prevents further impairment of pulmonary gas exchange.""The folk remedy for altitude sickness in Ecuador Peru and Bolivia is a tea made from the coca plant. See mate de coca.Steroids can be used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary or cerebral edema but do not treat the underlying AMS.Two studies in 2012 showed that ibuprofen 600 milligrams three times daily was effective at decreasing the severity and incidence of AMS; it was not clear if HAPE or HACE was affected.Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has also shown to be as good as ibuprofen for altitude sickness when tested on climbers ascending Everest.See alsoReferencesExternal linksTravel at High Altitude: a free booklet about how to keep healthy at altitude.

8,"Amblyopia also called lazy eye is a disorder of sight in which the brain fails to fully process input from one eye and over time favors the other eye. It results in decreased vision in an eye that typically appears normal in other respects. Amblyopia is the most common cause of decreased vision in a single eye among children and younger adults.The cause of amblyopia can be any condition that interferes with focusing during early childhood. This can occur from poor alignment of the eyes (strabismic) an eye being irregularly shaped such that focusing is difficult one eye being more nearsighted or farsighted than the other (refractive) or clouding of the lens of an eye (deprivational). After the underlying cause is addressed vision is not restored right away as the mechanism also involves the brain. Amblyopia can be difficult to detect so vision testing is recommended for all children around the ages of four to five.Early detection improves treatment success. Glasses may be all the treatment needed for some children. If this is not sufficient treatments which encourage or force the child to use the weaker eye are used. This is done by either using a patch or putting atropine in the stronger eye. Without treatment amblyopia typically persists. Treatment in adulthood is usually much less effective.Amblyopia begins by the age of five. In adults the disorder is estimated to affect 1–5% of the population. While treatment improves vision it does not typically restore it to normal in the affected eye. Amblyopia was first described in the 1600s. The condition may make people ineligible to be pilots or police officers. The word amblyopia is from Greek ἀμβλύς amblys meaning ""blunt"" and ὤψ ōps meaning ""sight"".Signs and symptomsMany people with amblyopia especially those who only have a mild form are not aware they have the condition until tested at older ages since the vision in their stronger eye is normal. People with amblyopia typically have poor stereo vision since it requires both eyes. They further may have on the affected eye poor pattern recognition poor visual acuity and low sensitivity to contrast and motion.Amblyopia is characterized by several functional abnormalities in spatial vision including reductions in visual acuity contrast sensitivity function and vernier acuity as well as spatial distortion abnormal spatial interactions and impaired contour detection. In addition individuals with amblyopia have binocular abnormalities such as impaired stereoacuity (stereoscopic acuity) and abnormal binocular summation. Also central vision in amblyopes is more crowded than central vision in normal observers.These deficits are usually specific to the amblyopic eye. Subclinical deficits of the ""better"" eye have also been demonstrated.People with amblyopia also have problems of binocular vision such as limited stereoscopic depth perception and usually have difficulty seeing the three-dimensional images in hidden stereoscopic displays such as autostereograms. Perception of depth from monocular cues such as size perspective and motion parallax remains normal.CauseAmblyopia has three main causes:Strabismic: by strabismus (misaligned eyes)Refractive: by anisometropia (difference of a certain degree of nearsightedness farsightedness or astigmatism) or by significant amount of equal refractive error in both eyesDeprivational: by deprivation of vision early in life by vision-obstructing disorders such as congenital cataractStrabismusStrabismus sometimes also incorrectly called lazy eye is a condition in which the eyes are misaligned. Strabismus usually results in normal vision in the preferred sighting (or ""fellow"") eye (the eye that the person prefers to use) but may cause abnormal vision in the deviating or strabismic eye due to the difference between the images projecting to the brain from the two eyes.Adult-onset strabismus usually causes double vision (diplopia) since the two eyes are not fixed on the same object.Childrens brains are more neuroplastic so can more easily adapt by suppressing images from one of the eyes eliminating the double vision. This plastic response of the brain interrupts the brains normal development resulting in the amblyopia. Recent evidence points to a cause of infantile strabismus lying with the input to the visual cortex.Those with strabismic amblyopia tend to show ocular motion deficits when reading even when they use the nonamblyopic eye. In particular they tend to make more saccades per line than persons with normal stereo vision and to have a reduced reading speed especially when reading a text with small font size.Strabismic amblyopia is treated by clarifying the visual image with glasses or encouraging use of the amblyopic eye with an eyepatch over the dominant eye or pharmacologic penalization of the better eye. Penalization usually consists of applying atropine drops to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex leading to the blurring of vision in the good eye. It also dilates the pupil. This helps to prevent the bullying and teasing associated with wearing a patch although sometimes application of the eye drops is challenging. The ocular alignment itself may be treated with surgical or nonsurgical methods depending on the type and severity of the strabismus.RefractiveRefractive amblyopia may result from anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes). Anisometropia exists when there is a difference in the power between the two eyes. The eye which provides the brain with a clearer image typically becomes the dominant eye. The image in the other eye is blurred which results in abnormal development of one half of the visual system. Refractive amblyopia is usually less severe than strabismic amblyopia and is commonly missed by primary care physicians because of its less dramatic appearance and lack of obvious physical manifestation such as with strabismus. Given that the refractive correction of anisometropia by means of spectacles typically leads to different image magnification for the two eyes which may in turn prevent binocular vision a refractive correction using contact lenses is to be considered. Also pediatric refractive surgery is a treatment option in particular if conventional approaches have failed due to aniseikonia or lack of compliance or both.Frequently amblyopia is associated with a combination of anisometropia and strabismus. In some cases the vision between the eyes can differ to the point where one eye has twice average vision while the other eye is completely blind.Deprivation and occlusionDeprivation amblyopia (amblyopia ex anopsia) results when the ocular media become opaque such as is the case with congenital cataract or corneal haziness. These opacities prevent adequate visual input from reaching the eye and disrupt development. If not treated in a timely fashion amblyopia may persist even after the cause of the opacity is removed. Sometimes drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) or some other problem causes the upper eyelid to physically occlude a childs vision which may cause amblyopia quickly.  Occlusion amblyopia may be a complication of a hemangioma that blocks some or all of the eye. Other possible causes of deprivation and occlusion amblyopia include obstruction in the vitreous and aphakia. Deprivation amblyopia accounts for less than 3% of all individuals affected by amblyopia.PathophysiologyAmblyopia is a developmental problem in the brain not any intrinsic organic neurological problem in the eyeball (although organic problems can lead to amblyopia which can continue to exist after the organic problem has resolved by medical intervention).The part of the brain receiving images from the affected eye is not stimulated properly and does not develop to its full visual potential. This has been confirmed by direct brain examination. David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981 for their work in showing the extent of the damage to ocular dominance columns produced in kittens by sufficient visual deprivation during the so-called ""critical period"". The maximum ""critical period"" in humans is from birth to two years old.DiagnosisAmblyopia is diagnosed by identifying low visual acuity in one or both eyes out of proportion to the structural abnormality of the eye and excluding other visual disorders as causes for the lowered visual acuity. It can be defined as an interocular difference of two lines or more in acuity (e.g. on Snellen chart) when the eye optics are maximally corrected. In young children visual acuity is difficult to measure and can be estimated by observing the reactions of the patient when one eye is covered including observing the patients ability to follow objects with one eye.Stereotests like the Lang stereotest are not reliable exclusion tests for amblyopia. A person who passes the Lang stereotest test is unlikely to have strabismic amblyopia but could nonetheless have refractive or deprivational amblyopia. Binocular retinal birefringence scanning may be able to identify already in very young children amblyopia that is associated with strabismus microstrabismus or reduced fixation accuracy. Diagnosis and treatment of amblyopia as early as possible is necessary to keep the vision loss to a minimum. Screening for amblyopia is recommended in all people between three and five years of age.TreatmentTreatment of strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia consists of correcting the optical deficit (wearing the necessary spectacle prescription) and often forcing use of the amblyopic eye by patching the good eye or instilling topical atropine in the good eye or both.: 130  Atropine appears to result in similar outcomes to patching. If there is overpatching or overpenalizing the good eye when treating amblyopia ""reverse amblyopia"" can result. Eye patching is usually done on a part-time schedule of about 4–6 hours a day. Treatment is continued as long as vision improves. It is not worthwhile continuing to patch for more than 6 months if no improvement continues.Deprivation amblyopia is treated by removing the opacity as soon as possible followed by patching or penalizing the good eye to encourage the use of the amblyopic eye. The earlier the treatment is initiated the easier and faster the treatment is and the less psychologically damaging. Also the chance of achieving 20/20 vision is greater if treatment is initiated early.One of the German public health insurance providers Barmer has changed its policy to cover as of 1 April 2014 the cost of software for amblyopic children whose condition did not improve through patching. The app offers dedicated eye exercises that the patient performs while wearing an eyepatch.Evidence for vision therapy is unclear as of 2011.Older ageTreatment of individuals age 9 through to adulthood is possible through applied perceptual learning. Tentative evidence shows that perceptual training may be beneficial in adults.EpidemiologyAmblyopia occurs in between 2 and 5% of the population in Western countries. In the UK 90% of visual health appointments in the child concern amblyopia.Depending on the chosen criterion for diagnosis between 1 and 4% of the children have amblyopia.ResearchA 2009 study widely reported in the popular press has suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may temporarily improve contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution in the affected eye of adults with amblyopia. This approach is still under development and the results await verification by other researchers. Comparable results may be achieved using different types of brain stimulation such as anodal transcranial direct current stimulation and theta burst rTMS.A 2013 study concluded that converging evidence indicates decorrelated binocular experience plays a pivotal role in the genesis of amblyopia and the associated residual deficits. Another study of 2013 suggests that playing a version of the popular game Tetris that is modified such that each eye sees separate components of the game may also help to treat this condition in adults. Furthermore the effects of this kind of therapy may be further enhanced by noninvasive brain stimulation as shown by a recent study using anodal tDCS.A 2014 Cochrane review sought to determine the effectiveness of occlusion treatment on patients with sensory deprivation amblyopia but no trials were found eligible to be included in the review. However  good outcomes from occlusion treatment for sensory deprivation amblyopia likely rely on compliance with the treatment.ReferencesFurther readingExternal linksNational Eye Institute (NEI) Resource GuideLazy Eye Site from the National Health Service UKLook After Your Eyes - patient information on Amblyopia or lazy eye by College of Optometrists"
9,Amoebiasis or amoebic dysentery is an infection of the intestines caused by a parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no mild or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include lethargy loss of weight colonic ulcerations abdominal pain diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding.Cysts of Entamoeba can survive for up to a month in soil or for up to 45 minutes under fingernails. Invasion of the intestinal lining results in bloody diarrhea. If the parasite reaches the bloodstream it can spread through the body most frequently ending up in the liver where it can cause amoebic liver abscesses. Liver abscesses can occur without previous diarrhea. Diagnosis is typically made by stool examination using microscopy but it can be difficult to distinguish E. hystolitica from other harmless entamoeba species. An increased white blood cell count may be present in severe cases. The most accurate test is finding specific antibodies in the blood but it may remain positive following treatment. Bacterial colitis can result in similar symptoms.Prevention of amoebiasis is by improved sanitation including separating food and water from faeces. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on the location of the infection. Amoebiasis in tissues is treated with either metronidazole tinidazole nitazoxanide dehydroemetine or chloroquine while luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. Effective treatment against all stages of the disease may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms may be treated with just one antibiotic and infections with symptoms are treated with two antibiotics.Amoebiasis is present all over the world though most cases occur in the developing world. About 480 million people are currently infected with about 40 million new cases per year with significant symptoms. This results in the death of between 40000–100000 people a year. The first case of amoebiasis was documented in 1875 and in 1891 the disease was described in detail resulting in the terms amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscess. Further evidence from the Philippines in 1913 found that upon swallowing cysts of E. histolytica volunteers developed the disease.Signs and symptomsMost infected people about 90% are asymptomatic but this disease has the potential to become serious. It is estimated that about 40000 to 100000 people worldwide die annually due to amoebiasis.Infections can sometimes last for years if there is no treatment. Symptoms take from a few days to a few weeks to develop and manifest themselves but usually it is about two to four weeks. Symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to dysentery with blood coupled with intense abdominal pains. Extra-intestinal complications might also arise as a result of invasive infection which includes colitis liver lung or brain abscesses. The blood comes from bleeding lesions created by the amoebae invading the lining of the colon. In about 10% of invasive cases the amoebae enter the bloodstream and may travel to other organs in the body. Most commonly this means the liver as this is where blood from the intestine reaches first but they can end up almost anywhere in the body.Onset time is highly variable and the average asymptomatic infection persists for over a year. It is theorized that the absence of symptoms or their intensity may vary with such factors as strain of amoeba immune response of the host and perhaps associated bacteria and viruses.In asymptomatic infections the amoeba lives by eating and digesting bacteria and food particles in the gut a part of the gastrointestinal tract. It does not usually come in contact with the intestine itself due to the protective layer of mucus that lines the gut. Disease occurs when amoeba comes in contact with the cells lining the intestine. It then secretes the same substances it uses to digest bacteria which include enzymes that destroy cell membranes and proteins. This process can lead to penetration and digestion of human tissues resulting first in flask-shaped ulcerations in the intestine. Entamoeba histolytica ingests the destroyed cells by phagocytosis and is often seen with red blood cells (a process known as erythrophagocytosis) inside when viewed in stool samples.  Especially in Latin America a granulomatous mass (known as an amoeboma) may form in the wall of the ascending colon or rectum due to long-lasting immunological cellular response and is sometimes confused with cancer.The ingestion of one viable cyst may cause an infection.Steroid therapy can occasionally provoke severe amoebic colitis in people with any E. histolytica infection. This bears high mortality: on average more than 50% with severe colitis die.CauseAmoebiasis is an infection caused by the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica.TransmissionAmoebiasis is usually transmitted by the fecal-oral route but it can also be transmitted indirectly through contact with dirty hands or objects as well as by anal-oral contact. Infection is spread through ingestion of the cyst form of the parasite a semi-dormant and hardy structure found in feces. Any non-encysted amoebae or trophozoites die quickly after leaving the body but may also be present in stool: these are rarely the source of new infections. Since amoebiasis is transmitted through contaminated food and water it is often endemic in regions of the world with limited modern sanitation systems including México Central America western South America South Asia and western and southern Africa.Amoebic dysentery is one form of travelers diarrhea although most travelers diarrhea is bacterial or viral in origin.PathogenesisAmoebiasis results from tissue destruction induced by the E. histolytica parasite. E. histolytica causes tissue damage by three main events: direct host cell killing inflammation and parasite invasion.DiagnosisWith colonoscopy it is possible to detect small ulcers of between 3–5mm but diagnosis may be difficult as the mucous membrane between these areas can look either healthy or inflamed.Trophozoites may be identified at the ulcer edge or within the tissue using immunohistochemical staining with specific anti-E. histolytica antibodies.Asymptomatic human infections are usually diagnosed by finding cysts shed in the stool. Various flotation or sedimentation procedures have been developed to recover the cysts from fecal matter and stains help to visualize the isolated cysts for microscopic examination. Since cysts are not shed constantly a minimum of three stools are examined. In symptomatic infections the motile form (the trophozoite) is often seen in fresh feces. Serological tests exist and most infected individuals (with symptoms or not) test positive for the presence of antibodies. The levels of antibody are much higher in individuals with liver abscesses. Serology only becomes positive about two weeks after infection. More recent developments include a kit that detects the presence of amoeba proteins in the feces and another that detects ameba DNA in feces. These tests are not in widespread use due to their expense.Microscopy is still by far the most widespread method of diagnosis around the world. However it is not as sensitive or accurate in diagnosis as the other tests available. It is important to distinguish the E. histolytica cyst from the cysts of nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa such as Entamoeba coli by its appearance.  E. histolytica cysts have a maximum of four nuclei while the commensal Entamoeba coli cyst has up to 8 nuclei.  Additionally in E. histolytica the endosome is centrally located in the nucleus while it is usually off-center in Entamoeba coli.  Finally chromatoidal bodies in E. histolytica cysts are rounded while they are jagged in Entamoeba coli. However other species Entamoeba dispar and E. moshkovskii are also commensals and cannot be distinguished from E. histolytica under the microscope. As E. dispar is much more common than E. histolytica in most parts of the world this means that there is a lot of incorrect diagnosis of E. histolytica infection taking place. The WHO recommends that infections diagnosed by microscopy alone should not be treated if they are asymptomatic and there is no other reason to suspect that the infection is actually E. histolytica.  Detection of cysts or trophozoites stools under microscope may require examination of several samples over several days to determine if they are present because cysts are shed intermittently and may not show up in every sample.Typically the organism can no longer be found in the feces once the disease goes extra-intestinal. Serological tests are useful in detecting infection by E. histolytica if the organism goes extra-intestinal and in excluding the organism from the diagnosis of other disorders. An Ova & Parasite (O&P) test or an E. histolytica fecal antigen assay is the proper assay for intestinal infections. Since antibodies may persist for years after clinical cure a positive serological result may not necessarily indicate an active infection. A negative serological result however can be equally important in excluding suspected tissue invasion by E. histolytica.Stool antigen detection tests have helped to overcome some of the limitations of stool microscopy. Antigen detection tests are easy to use but they have variable sensitivity and specificity especially in low-endemic areas.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis but remains underutilized.PreventionTo help prevent the spread of amoebiasis around the home :Wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot running water for at least 10 seconds after using the toilet or changing a babys diaper and before handling food.Clean bathrooms and toilets often; pay particular attention to toilet seats and taps.Avoid sharing towels or face washers.To help prevent infection:Avoid raw vegetables when in endemic areas as they may have been fertilized using human feces.Boil water or treat with iodine tablets.Avoid eating street foods especially in public places where others are sharing sauces in one containerGood sanitary practice as well as responsible sewage disposal or treatment are necessary for the prevention of E. histolytica infection on an endemic level.  E.histolytica cysts are usually resistant to chlorination therefore sedimentation and filtration of water supplies are necessary to reduce the incidence of infection.E. histolytica cysts may be recovered from contaminated food by methods similar to those used for recovering Giardia lamblia cysts from feces. Filtration is probably the most practical method for recovery from drinking water and liquid foods. E. histolytica cysts must be distinguished from cysts of other parasitic (but nonpathogenic) protozoa and from cysts of free-living protozoa as discussed above. Recovery procedures are not very accurate; cysts are easily lost or damaged beyond recognition which leads to many falsely negative results in recovery tests.TreatmentE. histolytica infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver. Those with symptoms require treatment with two medications an amoebicidal tissue-active agent and a luminal cysticidal agent. Individuals that are asymptomatic only need a luminal cysticidal agent.PrognosisIn the majority of cases amoebas remain in the gastrointestinal tract of the hosts. Severe ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces occurs in less than 16% of cases. In fewer cases the parasite invades the soft tissues most commonly the liver. Only rarely are masses formed (amoebomas) that lead to intestinal obstruction.(Mistaken for Ca caecum and appendicular mass) Other local complications include bloody diarrhea pericolic and pericaecal abscess.Complications of hepatic amoebiasis includes subdiaphragmatic abscess perforation of diaphragm to pericardium and pleural cavity perforation to abdominal cavital (amoebic peritonitis) and perforation of skin (amoebiasis cutis).Pulmonary amoebiasis can occur from liver lesions by spread through the blood or by perforation of pleural cavity and lung. It can cause lung abscess pulmono pleural fistula empyema lung and broncho pleural fistula. It can also reach the brain through blood vessels and cause amoebic brain abscess and amoebic meningoencephalitis. Cutaneous amoebiasis can also occur in skin around sites of colostomy wound perianal region region overlying visceral lesion and at the site of drainage of liver abscess.Urogenital tract amoebiasis derived from intestinal lesion can cause amoebic vulvovaginitis (Mays disease) rectovesicle fistula and rectovaginal fistula.Entamoeba histolytica infection is associated with malnutrition and stunting of growth in children.EpidemiologyAmoebiasis caused about 55000 deaths worldwide in 2010 down from 68000 in 1990.In older textbooks it is often stated that 10% of the worlds population is infected with Entamoeba histolytica.  Nevertheless this means that there are up to 50 million true E. histolytica infections and approximately seventy thousand die each year mostly from liver abscesses or other complications.  Although usually considered a tropical parasite the first case reported (in 1875) was actually in St Petersburg in Russia near the Arctic Circle. Infection is more common in warmer areas but this is because of both poorer hygiene and the parasitic cysts surviving longer in warm moist conditions.HistoryAmoebiasis was first described by Fedor A. Lösch in 1875 in northern Russia. The most dramatic incident in the US was the Chicago Worlds Fair outbreak in 1933 caused by contaminated drinking water. There were more than a thousand cases with 98 deaths. It has been known since 1897 that at least one non-disease-causing species of Entamoeba existed (Entamoeba coli) but it was first formally recognized by the WHO in 1997 that E. histolytica was two species despite this having first been proposed in 1925. In addition to the now-recognized E. dispar evidence shows there are at least two other species of Entamoeba that look the same in humans: E. moshkovskii and Entamoeba bangladeshi. The reason these species havent been differentiated until recently is because of the reliance on appearance.Joel Connolly of the Chicago Bureau of Sanitary Engineering brought the outbreak to an end when he found that defective plumbing permitted sewage to contaminate drinking water. In 1998 there was an outbreak of amoebiasis in the Republic of Georgia. Between 26 May and 3 September 1998 177 cases were reported including 71 cases of intestinal amoebiasis and 106 probable cases of liver abscess.The Nicobarese people have attested to the medicinal properties found in Glochidion calocarpum a plant common to India saying that its bark and seed are most effective in curing abdominal disorders associated with amoebiasis.Society and cultureAn outbreak of amoebic dysentery occurs in Diana Gabaldons novel A Breath of Snow and Ashes.ReferencesExternal linksAmoebiasis - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
10,"Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease affecting ruminants dogs and horses and is caused by Anaplasma bacteria. Anaplasmosis is an infectious but not contagious disease. Anaplasmosis can be transmitted through mechanical and biological vector processes. Anaplasmosis can also be referred to as ""yellow bag"" or ""yellow fever"" because the infected animal can develop a jaundiced look. Other signs of infection include weight loss diarrhea paleness of the skin aggressive behavior and high fever.Many different tick species can carry the bacteria that cause anaplasmosis.  The two major bacterial pathogens are Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. These microorganisms  are Gram-negative and infect red blood cells. Once the host is infected with anaplasmosis the immune system will try to fight off and kill the infected red blood cells but will also kill healthy red blood cells. The Anaplasma sparouinense species is responsible for a rare zoonosis the Sparouine anaplasmosis detected only in French Guiana South America. This disease was described from a clandestine gold miner working deep in rainforest. Infection of his red blood cells led to a severe deterioration of his health and required his hospitalization. Molecular typing showed that Anaplasma sparouinense is distinct to all known species and more genetically related to recently described Anaplasma species causing infections in rainforest wild fauna of Brazil.While there are no current live or inactivated vaccines effective for all strains of A. marginale approved by the USDA for anaplasmosis there are other means of prevention. Tick and fly control for herds of ruminants can be effective but also labor intensive. Chemical methods can also be used including sanitizing surgical equipment after each use. Tetracycline drugs are the most common treatment for anaplasmosis and can provide the animal with immunity for a period of time. The disease is more common in the South and West parts of the United States but is no longer considered a major problem since the use of tetracycline drugs.TransmissionMechanical and biological vector transmission work in different ways but both lead to infection of the red blood cells. Mechanical transmission happens in two ways one when red blood cells are inoculated with the blood parasite through surgical equipment including needles dehorners ear taggers castrating knives and tattoo instruments. Another mechanical transmission mode is through the mouthparts of biting flies who carry an Anaplasma species of blood parasite.Biological vector transmission is through ticks that carry a blood parasite able to cause anaplasmosis. The most common Anaplasmosis-causing tick is Ixodes scapularis also known as the black-legged tick or the deer tick. Ticks who contain species of many different Anaplasma species can transmit this disease through a bite. The blood parasite survives and can multiply in the tick and can sit dormant for months without being transmitted to an animal. When bitten by a tick carrying a blood parasite the blood parasite can then enter the new host and cause infection.Once infected with a species of Anaplasma the parasite multiplies in the blood stream and attaches to red blood cells. The immune system will attempt to kill the infected blood cells but will also kill uninfected red blood cells in the process. The number of red blood cells being destroyed becomes larger than new red blood cells being made causing the host to become anemic and leading to many other symptoms. Once infected with anaplasmosis the cattle will always be a carrier of the infectious disease and calves born from carriers will also carry the disease.Signs and symptomsClassic signs and symptoms of anaplasmosis will not occur until 3–6 weeks after infection. The most common symptoms of anaplasmosis include fever a decreased number of white blood cells platelets in the bloodstream and abnormally elevated levels of liver enzymes. The erythema chronicum migrans rash may be seen with anaplasmosis as it is co-transmitted in 10% of Lyme disease cases.Anemia may be severe and result in cardiovascular changes such as an increase in heart rate. Blood in the urine may occur due to the lysis of red blood cells. General systemic signs include diarrhea anorexia and weight loss. Infected animals may develop a jaundiced look which then turns into paleness around the eyes muzzle lips and teats of the cattle.All cattle are susceptible to infection by Anaplasma marginale but the severity worsens with age increase. Older cattle tend to exhibit the most severe clinical symptoms; cattle aged 1–3 may also show severe symptoms but are able to recover easier.CausesThe two major species that cause anaplasmosis in ruminants include Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Anaplasma marginale is found worldwide and is transmitted by Rhipicephalus ticks. Anaplasma phagocytophilum is also found worldwide mainly transmitted by Ixodes ticks. Other species that cause anaplasmosis in specific species include:Cattle:Anaplasma centrale - found mainly in South America Africa and the Middle EastSheep and goats:Anaplasma ovis - found worldwide. There is a prevalence of 82.9% in sheep and 74.9% in goats. This species is the most prevalent for causing anaplasmosis in sheep and goats although Anaplasma phagocytophilium can also cause the disease. Anaplasma phagocytophilium has a prevalence of 11.9% in sheep and 15.2% in goats.MorphologyThere are many strains of Anaplasma marginale all with differing morphology antigenic properties protein sequence and ability to be transmitted by ticks. Major surface proteins (MSP) have been found to play a major role in the infection by Anaplasma marginale. Out of the six MSP found on this species three of the major surface proteins do not seem to differ between all strains those including MSP1a MSP4 and MSP5. The msp1a gene which codes for MSP1a is used as a marker for the identification of Anaplasma marginale because it has shown to be conserved in the multiplication of rickettsia in cattle and ticks and has been shown to be involved in adhesion to bovine erythrocytes and tick cells.Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a gram-negative bacterium that does not have lipopolysaccharides or peptidoglycan. The outer membrane does not have a capsule and is coarse with irregular periplasmic spaces. This species was originally included in the genus Ehrlichia (Ehrlichia phagocytophilium) but is now included in the genus Anaplasma (Anaplasma phagocytophilium).PreventionCurrently no live or inactivated vaccines have been approved by the USDA that are effective against all strains of A. marginale. Some vaccines that rely on erythrocyte-derived antigen sources provide immunity or prevent clinical disease although these do not prevent cattle from being infected with A. marginale. Other means of prevention can include testing all ruminants in a herd and eliminating any individuals who test positive for anaplasmosis leading to an anaplasmosis-free herd. Vector control measures can also be used. Tick control is widely used in some countries including Africa but rarely used in the United States due to the fact that this prevention method is labor-intensive and expensive. In contrast the control of flies is effective and there are many ways to do this. Chemical agents can be used sanitation methods (such as cleaning stalls/pens regularly manure management and protecting feed) as well as biological control by natural enemies of flies (including bees mites parasitoids). Ways to prevent iatrogenic transmission include avoiding re-using of needles and sanitizing medical equipment between uses. Antimicrobial treatment can also be used although it is more commonly used in the case of active infection. This includes the drugs tetracycline and imidocarb and is used in healthy ruminants to decrease the clinical effects of an active infection.TreatmentThe most common source of treatment is the use of tetracycline drugs (including tetracycline chlortetracycline oxytetracycline rolitetracycline doxycycline and minocycline) and imidocarb. An injection of tetracycline drugs can give ruminants immunity to Anaplasma species for at least eight months. Imidocarb has been shown to be highly effective against Anaplasma marginale but has been identified as a possible carcinogen and is not approved in the United States or Europe. Countries such as South Africa Australia Israel and South America have used live vaccines containing infectious Anaplasma centrale to prevent infection of Anaplasma marginale. Live vaccines are prohibited in the United States and there has been production of vaccines consisting of nonliving Anaplasma marginale pulled from infected bovine erythrocytes which can provide some immunity but leaves cattle susceptible to other strains of Anaplasma marginale. Supportive therapy such as blood products and fluids may be necessary.EpidemiologyIn the United States anaplasmosis is notably present in the South and West where the tick hosts Ixodes spp. are found.  It is also a seemingly increasing antibody in humans in Europe.  Although vaccines have been developed none are currently available in the United States. Early in the 20th century this disease was considered one of major economic consequence in the Western United States.  In the 1980s and 1990s control of ticks through new acaricides and practical treatment with prolonged-action antibiotics notably tetracycline has led to the point where the disease is no longer considered a major problem. The disease affects immunoglobulin G therefore G-specific antibody levels can be used to diagnose the disease.In 2005 A. ovis was found in reindeer populations in Mongolia. This pathogen and its associated syndrome (characterized by lethargy fever and pale mucous membranes) was previously observed in only wild sheep and goats in the region and is the first observed occurrence of A. ovis in reindeer.In Australia bovine anaplasmosis caused by A. marginale is found in only the northern and eastern parts of Australia where the cattle tick is present. It was probably introduced as early as 1829 by cattle from Indonesia infested with the cattle tick Boophilus microplus.The veterinarian George P. Broussard of New Iberia Louisiana conducted important research on anaplasmosis and brucellosis.References== External links =="
11,Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare WHO grade III type of astrocytoma which is a type of cancer of the brain. In the United States the annual incidence rate for anaplastic astrocytoma is 0.44 per 100000 people.Signs and symptomsInitial presenting symptoms most commonly are headache depressed mental status focal neurological deficits and/or seizures. The growth rate and mean interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is approximately 1.5–2 years but is highly variable being intermediate between that of low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Seizures are less common among patients with anaplastic astrocytomas compared to low-grade lesions.CausesMost high-grade gliomas occur sporadically or without identifiable cause. However a small proportion (less than 5%) of persons with malignant astrocytoma have a definite or suspected hereditary predisposition. The main hereditary predispositions are mainly neurofibromatosis type I Li-Fraumeni syndrome hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and tuberous sclerosis. Anaplastic astrocytomas have also been associated with previous exposure to vinyl chloride and to high doses of radiation therapy to the brain.PathologyAnaplastic astrocytomas fall under the category of high grade gliomas (WHO grade III-IV) which are pathologically undifferentiated gliomas that carry a poor clinical prognosis.  Unlike glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) anaplastic astrocytomas lack vascular proliferation and necrosis on pathologic evaluation.  Compared to grade II tumors anaplastic astrocytomas are more cellular demonstrate more atypia and mitoses are seen.TreatmentThe standard initial treatment is to remove as much of the tumor as possible without worsening neurologic deficits. Radiation therapy has been shown to prolong survival and is a standard component of treatment. There is no proven benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy or supplementing other treatments for this kind of tumor. Although temozolomide is effective for treating recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma its role as an adjuvant to radiation therapy has not been fully tested.Quality of life after treatment depends heavily on the area of the brain that housed the tumor. In many cases patients with anaplastic astrocytoma may experience various types of paralysis speech impediments difficulties planning and skewed sensory perception. Most cases of paralysis and speech difficulties can be rehabilitated with speech occupational physical and vision therapy.PrognosisThe age-standardized 5-year relative survival rate is 23.6%. Patients with this tumor are 46 times more likely to die than matched members of the general population. It is important to note that prognosis across age groups is different especially during the first three years post-diagnosis. When the elderly population is compared with young adults the excess hazard ratio (a hazard ratio that is corrected for differences in mortality across age groups) decreases from 10.15 to 1.85 at 1 to 3 years meaning that the elderly population are much more likely to die in the first year post-diagnosis when compared to young adults (aged 15 to 40) but after three years this difference is reduced markedly.Typical median survival for anaplastic astrocytoma is 2–3 years.  Secondary progression to glioblastoma multiforme is common. Radiation younger age female sex treatment after 2000 and surgery were associated with improved survival in AA patients.== References ==
12,"Anorexia nervosa often referred to simply as anorexia is an eating disorder characterized by low weight food restriction body image disturbance fear of gaining weight and an overpowering desire to be thin. Anorexia is a term of Greek origin: an- (ἀν- prefix denoting negation) and orexis (ὄρεξις ""appetite"") translating literally to ""a loss of appetite""; the adjective nervosa indicating the functional and non-organic nature of the disorder. Anorexia nervosa  was coined by Gull in 1873 but despite literal translation the symptom of hunger is frequently present and the pathological control of this instinct is a source of satisfaction for the patients.Individuals with anorexia nervosa commonly see themselves as overweight although they are in fact underweight. The DSM-5 describes this perceptual symptom as ""disturbance in the way in which ones body weight or shape is experienced"". In research and clinical settings this symptom is called ""body image disturbance"". Individuals with anorexia nervosa also often deny that they have a problem with low weight. They may weigh themselves frequently eat small amounts and only eat certain foods. Some exercise excessively force themselves to vomit (in the ""anorexia purging"" subtype) or use laxatives to lose weight and control body shapes and/or binge eat. Medical complications may include osteoporosis infertility and heart damage among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods. In extreme cases patients with anorexia nervosa who continually refuse significant dietary intake and weight restoration interventions and are declared incompetent to make decisions by a psychiatrist may be fed by force under restraint via nasogastric tube after asking their parents or proxies to make the decision for them.The cause of anorexia is currently unknown. There appear to be some genetic components with identical twins more often affected than fraternal twins. Cultural factors also appear to play a role with societies that value thinness having higher rates of the disease. Additionally it occurs more commonly among those involved in activities that value thinness such as high-level athletics modeling and dancing. Anorexia often begins following a major life-change or stress-inducing event. The diagnosis requires a significantly low weight and the severity of disease is based on body mass index (BMI) in adults with mild disease having a BMI of greater than 17 moderate a BMI of 16 to 17 severe a BMI of 15 to 16 and extreme a BMI less than 15. In children a BMI for age percentile of less than the 5th percentile is often used.Treatment of anorexia involves restoring the patient back to a healthy weight treating their underlying psychological problems and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain they may be used to help with associated anxiety or depression. Different therapy methods may be useful such as cognitive behavioral therapy or an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child known as Maudsley family therapy. Sometimes people require admission to a hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding is unclear; such an intervention may be highly distressing for both anorexia patients and healthcare staff when administered against the patients will under restraint. Some people with anorexia will have a single episode and recover while others may have recurring episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with the regaining of weight.Globally anorexia is estimated to affect 2.9 million people as of 2015. It is estimated to occur in 0.3% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life. About 0.4% of young women are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur ten times more commonly among women than men. Rates in most of the developing world are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. In 2013 it directly resulted in about 600 deaths globally up from 400 deaths in 1990. Eating disorders also increase a persons risk of death from a wide range of other causes including suicide. About 5% of people with anorexia die from complications over a ten-year period a nearly six times increased risk. The term ""anorexia nervosa"" was first used in 1873 by William Gull to describe this condition.In recent years evolutionary psychiatry as an emerging scientific discipline has been studying mental disorders from an evolutionary perspective. It is still debated whether eating disorders such as anorexia have evolutionary functions or if they are problems resulting from a modern lifestyle.Signs and symptomsAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by attempts to lose weight to the point of starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a number of signs and symptoms the type and severity of which may vary and be present but not readily apparent.Anorexia nervosa and the associated malnutrition that results from self-imposed starvation can cause complications in every major organ system in the body. Hypokalaemia a drop in the level of potassium in the blood is a sign of anorexia nervosa. A significant drop in potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms constipation fatigue muscle damage and paralysis.Signs and symptoms may be classified in physical cognitive affective behavioral and perceptual:Physical symptomsA low body mass index for ones age and heightAmenorrhea a symptom that occurs after prolonged weight loss causing menstruation to stopDry hair and skin as well as hair thinningFear of even the slightest weight gain; taking all precautionary measures to avoid weight gain or becoming ""overweight""Rapid continuous weight lossLanugo: soft fine hair growing over the face and bodyBradycardia or tachycardia.Chronic fatigueOrange discoloration of the skin particularly the feet (Carotenosis)InfertilityHalitosis (from vomiting or starvation-induced ketosis)Hypotension or orthostatic hypotensionHaving severe muscle tension aches and painsInsomniaAbdominal distensionCognitive symptomsAn obsession with counting calories and monitoring fat contents of food.Preoccupation with food recipes or cooking; may cook elaborate dinners for others but not eat the food themselves or consume a very small portion.Admiration of thinner people.Thoughts of being fat or not thin enoughAn altered mental representation of ones bodyImpaired theory of mind exacerbated by lower BMI and depressionDifficulty in abstract thinking and problem solvingRigid and inflexible thinkingPoor self-esteemHypercriticism and perfectionismAffective symptomsDepressionAshamed of oneself or ones bodyAnxiety disordersRapid mood swingsEmotional dysregulationAlexithymiaBehavioral symptomsFood restrictions despite being underweight or at a healthy weight.Food rituals such as cutting food into tiny pieces refusing to eat around others and hiding or discarding of food.Purging (only in the anorexia purging subtype) with laxatives diet pills ipecac syrup or diuretics to flush food out of their system after eating or engage in self-induced vomiting.Excessive exercise including micro-exercising for example making small persistent movements of fingers or toes.Self harming or self-loathing.Solitude: may avoid friends and family and become more withdrawn and secretive.Perceptual symptomsPerception of self as overweight in contradiction to an underweight reality (namely ""body image disturbance"")Intolerance to cold and frequent complaints of being cold; body temperature may lower (hypothermia) in an effort to conserve energy due to malnutrition.Altered body schema (i.e. an implicit representation of the body evoked by acting)Altered interoceptionInteroceptionInteroception involves the conscious and unconscious sense of the internal state of the body and it has an important role in homeostasis and regulation of emotions. Aside from noticeable physiological dysfunction interoceptive deficits also prompt individuals with anorexia to concentrate on distorted perceptions of multiple elements of their body image. This exists in both people with anorexia and in healthy individuals due to impairment in interoceptive sensitivity and interoceptive awareness.Aside from weight gain and outer appearance people with anorexia also report abnormal bodily functions such as indistinct feelings of fullness. This provides an example of miscommunication between internal signals of the body and the brain. Due to impaired interoceptive sensitivity powerful cues of fullness may be detected prematurely in highly sensitive individuals which can result in decreased calorie consumption and generate anxiety surrounding food intake in anorexia patients. People with anorexia also report difficulty identifying and describing their emotional feelings and the inability to distinguish emotions from bodily sensations in general called alexithymia.Interoceptive awareness and emotion are deeply intertwined and could mutually impact each other in abnormalities. Anorexia patients also exhibit emotional regulation difficulties that ignite emotionally-cued eating behaviors such as restricting food or excessive exercising. Impaired interoceptive sensitivity and interoceptive awareness can lead anorexia patients to adapt distorted interpretations of weight gain that are cued by physical sensations related to digestion (e.g. fullness). Combined these interoceptive and emotional elements could together trigger maladaptive and negatively reinforced behavioral responses that assist in the maintenance of anorexia. In addition to metacognition people with anorexia also have difficulty with social cognition including interpreting others emotions and demonstrating empathy. Abnormal interoceptive awareness and interoceptive sensitivity shown through all of these examples have been observed so frequently in anorexia that they have become key characteristics of the illness.ComorbidityOther psychological issues may factor into anorexia nervosa. Some people have a previous disorder which may increase their vulnerability to developing an eating disorder and some develop them afterwards. The presence of psychiatric comorbidity has been shown to affect the severity and type of anorexia nervosa symptoms in both adolescents and adults.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) are highly comorbid with AN. OCD is linked with more severe symptomatology and worse prognosis. The causality between personality disorders and eating disorders has yet to be fully established. Other comorbid conditions include depression alcoholism borderline and other personality disorders anxiety disorders attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Depression and anxiety are the most common comorbidities and depression is associated with a worse outcome. Autism spectrum disorders occur more commonly among people with eating disorders than in the general population. Zucker et al. (2007) proposed that conditions on the autism spectrum make up the cognitive endophenotype underlying anorexia nervosa and appealed for increased interdisciplinary collaboration.CausesThere is evidence for biological psychological developmental and sociocultural risk factors but the exact cause of eating disorders is unknown.GeneticAnorexia nervosa is highly heritable. Twin studies have shown a heritability rate of 28–58%. First-degree relatives of those with anorexia have roughly 12 times the risk of developing anorexia. Association studies have been performed studying 128 different polymorphisms related to 43 genes including genes involved in regulation of eating behavior motivation and reward mechanics personality traits and emotion. Consistent associations have been identified for polymorphisms associated with agouti-related peptide brain derived neurotrophic factor catechol-o-methyl transferase SK3 and opioid receptor delta-1. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may contribute to the development or maintenance of anorexia nervosa though clinical research in this area is in its infancy.A 2019 study found a genetic relationship with mental disorders such as schizophrenia obsessive–compulsive disorder anxiety disorder and depression; and metabolic functioning with a negative correlation with fat mass type 2 diabetes and leptin.One gene that has been linked to anorexia might be of particular interest.  This gene codes for a protein called the estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha).  In some tissues this gene alters the ability of estrogen and estrogen receptors to interact with DNA and change the function of cells. Since estrogen has potent effects upon appetite and feeding any genetic abnormality in the estrogen signaling pathway could contribute to the symptoms of anorexia and explain why anorexia typically appears in young women just after the onset of puberty.EnvironmentalObstetric complications: prenatal and perinatal complications may factor into the development of anorexia nervosa such as preterm birth maternal anemia diabetes mellitus preeclampsia placental infarction and neonatal heart abnormalities. Neonatal complications may also have an influence on harm avoidance one of the personality traits associated with the development of AN.Neuroendocrine dysregulation: altered signalling of peptides that facilitate communication between the gut brain and adipose tissue such as ghrelin leptin neuropeptide Y and orexin may contribute to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa by disrupting regulation of hunger and satiety.Gastrointestinal diseases: people with gastrointestinal disorders may be more at risk of developing disorders of eating practices than the general population principally restrictive eating disturbances. An association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found. The role that gastrointestinal symptoms play in the development of eating disorders seems rather complex. Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons causing alterations to their eating patterns. Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk. It has been documented that some people with celiac disease irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease who are not conscious about the importance of strictly following their diet choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss. On the other hand individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods. Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom (such as decreased appetite abdominal pain bloating distension vomiting diarrhea or constipation) weight loss or growth failure; and also routinely ask celiac patients about weight or body shape concerns dieting or vomiting for weight control to evaluate the possible presence of eating disorders especially in women.Studies have hypothesized the continuance of disordered eating patterns may be epiphenomena of starvation. The results of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment showed normal controls exhibit many of the behavioral patterns of AN when subjected to starvation. This may be due to the numerous changes in the neuroendocrine system which results in a self-perpetuating cycle.Anorexia nervosa is more likely to occur in a persons pubertal years. Some explanatory hypotheses for the rising prevalence of eating disorders in adolescence are ""increase of adipose tissue in girls hormonal changes of puberty societal expectations of increased independence and autonomy that are particularly difficult for anorexic adolescents to meet; [and] increased influence of the peer group and its values.""PsychologicalEarly theories of the cause of anorexia linked it to childhood sexual abuse or dysfunctional families; evidence is conflicting and well-designed research is needed. The fear of food is known as sitiophobia or cibophobia and is part of the differential diagnosis. Other psychological causes of anorexia include low self-esteem feeling like there is lack of control depression anxiety and loneliness. People with anorexia are in general highly perfectionistic and most have obsessive compulsive personality traits which may facilitate sticking to a restricted diet. It has been suggested that patients with anorexia are rigid in their thought patterns and place a high level of importance upon being thin.A risk factor for anorexia is trauma. Although the prevalence rates vary greatly between 37% and 100% there appears to be a link between traumatic events and eating disorder diagnosis. Approximately 72% of individuals with anorexia report experiencing a traumatic event prior to the onset of eating disorder symptoms with binge-purge subtype reporting the highest rates. There are many traumatic events that may be risk factors for development of anorexia the first identified traumatic event predicting anorexia was childhood sexual abuse. However other traumatic events such as physical and emotional abuse have also been found to be risk factors. Interpersonal as opposed to non-interpersonal trauma has been seen as the most common type of traumatic event which can encompass sexual physical and emotional abuse. Individuals who experience repeated trauma like those who experience trauma perpetrated by a caregiver or loved one have increased symptom severity of anorexia and a greater prevalence of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.In individuals with anorexia the prevalence rates for those who also qualify for a PTSD diagnosis ranges from 4% to 52% in non-clinical samples to 10% to 47% in clinical samples. A complicated symptom profile develops when trauma and anorexia meld; the bodily experience of the individual is changed and intrusive thoughts and sensations may be experienced. Traumatic events can lead to intrusive and obsessive thoughts and the symptom of anorexia that has been most closely linked to a PTSD diagnosis is increased obsessive thoughts pertaining to food. Similarly impulsivity is linked to the purge and binge-purge subtypes of anorexia trauma and PTSD. Emotional trauma (e.g. invalidation chaotic family environment in childhood) may lead to difficulty with emotions particularly the identification of and how physical sensations contribute to the emotional response. Trauma and traumatic events can disturb an individuals sense of self and affect their ability to thrive especially within their bodies.When trauma is perpetrated on an individual it can lead to feelings of not being safe within their own body; that their body is for others to use and not theirs alone. Individuals may experience a feeling of disconnection from their body after a traumatic experience leading to a desire to distance themselves from the body. Trauma overwhelms individuals emotionally physically and psychologically. Both physical and sexual abuse can lead to an individual seeing their body as belonging to an ""other"" and not to the ""self"". Individuals who feel as though they have no control over their bodies due to trauma may use food as a means of control because the choice to eat is an unmatched expression of control. By exerting control over food individuals can choose when to eat and how much to eat. Individuals particularly children experiencing abuse may feel a loss of control over their life circumstances and their own bodies. Particularly sexual abuse but also physical abuse can make individuals feel that the body is not a safe place and an object over which another has control. Starvation in the case of anorexia may also lead to reduction in the body as a sexual object making starvation a solution. Restriction may also be a means by which the pain an individual is experiencing can be communicated.SociologicalAnorexia nervosa has been increasingly diagnosed since 1950; the increase has been linked to vulnerability and internalization of body ideals. People in professions where there is a particular social pressure to be thin (such as models and dancers) were more likely to develop anorexia and those with anorexia have much higher contact with cultural sources that promote weight loss. This trend can also be observed for people who partake in certain sports such as jockeys and wrestlers. There is a higher incidence and prevalence of anorexia nervosa in sports with an emphasis on aesthetics where low body fat is advantageous and sports in which one has to make weight for competition. Family group dynamics can play a role in the cause of anorexia including negative expressed emotion in overprotective families where blame is frequently experienced among its members. When there is a constant pressure from people to be thin teasing and bullying can cause low self-esteem and other psychological symptoms.Media effectsPersistent exposure to media that present body ideals may constitute a risk factor for body dissatisfaction and anorexia nervosa. The cultural ideal for body shape for men versus women continues to favor slender women and athletic V-shaped muscular men. A 2002 review found that of the magazines most popular among people aged 18 to 24 years those read by men unlike those read by women were more likely to feature ads and articles on shape than on diet. Body dissatisfaction and internalization of body ideals are risk factors for anorexia nervosa that threaten the health of both male and female populations.Another online aspect contributing to higher rates of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa are websites and communities on social media that stress the importance of attainment of body ideals extol and promote anorexia nervosa through the use of religious metaphors lifestyle descriptions ""thinspiration"" or ""fitspiration"" (inspirational photo galleries and quotes that aim to serve as motivators for attainment of body ideals). Pro-anorexia websites reinforce internalization of body ideals and the importance of their attainment.The media portray a false view of what people truly look like. In magazines and movies and even on billboards most of the actors/models are digitally altered in multiple ways. People then strive to look like these ""perfect"" role models when in reality they are not near perfection themselves.MechanismsEvidence from physiological pharmacological and neuroimaging studies suggest serotonin (also called 5-HT) may play a role in anorexia. While acutely ill metabolic changes may produce a number of biological findings in people with anorexia that are not necessarily causative of the anorexic behavior. For example abnormal hormonal responses to challenges with serotonergic agents have been observed during acute illness but not recovery. Nevertheless increased cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a metabolite of serotonin) and changes in anorectic behavior in response to acute tryptophan depletion (tryptophan is a metabolic precursor to serotonin) support a role in anorexia. The activity of the 5-HT2A receptors has been reported to be lower in patients with anorexia in a number of cortical regions evidenced by lower binding potential of this receptor as measured by PET or SPECT independent of the state of illness. While these findings may be confounded by comorbid psychiatric disorders taken as a whole they indicate serotonin in anorexia. These alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness anxiety and appetite dysregulation.Neuroimaging studies investigating the functional connectivity between brain regions have observed a number of alterations in networks related to cognitive control introspection and sensory function. Alterations in networks related to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may be related to excessive cognitive control of eating related behaviors. Similarly altered somatosensory integration and introspection may relate to abnormal body image. A review of functional neuroimaging studies reported reduced activations in ""bottom up"" limbic region and increased activations in ""top down"" cortical regions which may play a role in restrictive eating.Compared to controls people who have recovered from anorexia show reduced activation in the reward system in response to food and reduced correlation between self reported liking of a sugary drink and activity in the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. Increased binding potential of 11C radiolabelled raclopride in the striatum interpreted as reflecting decreased endogenous dopamine due to competitive displacement has also been observed.Structural neuroimaging studies have found global reductions in both gray matter and white matter as well as increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Regional decreases in the left hypothalamus left inferior parietal lobe right lentiform nucleus and right caudate have also been reported in acutely ill patients. However these alterations seem to be associated with acute malnutrition and largely reversible with weight restoration at least in nonchronic cases in younger people. In contrast some studies have reported increased orbitofrontal cortex volume in currently ill and  in recovered patients although findings are inconsistent. Reduced white matter integrity in the fornix has also been reported.DiagnosisA diagnostic assessment includes the persons current circumstances biographical history current symptoms and family history. The assessment also includes a mental state examination which is an assessment of the persons current mood and thought content focusing on views on weight and patterns of eating.DSM-5Anorexia nervosa is classified under the Feeding and Eating Disorders in the latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). There is no specific BMI cut-off that defines low weight required for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (all of which needing to be met for diagnosis) are:Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a low body weight. (Criterion A)Intense fear of gaining weight or persistent behaviors that interfere with gaining weight. (Criterion B)Disturbance in the way a persons weight or body shape is experienced or a lack of recognition about the risks of the low body weight. (Criterion C)Relative to the previous version of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR) the 2013 revision (DSM5) reflects changes in the criteria for anorexia nervosa. Most notably the amenorrhea (absent period) criterion was removed. Amenorrhea was removed for several reasons: it does not apply to males it is not applicable for females before or after the age of menstruation or taking birth control pills and some women who meet the other criteria for AN still report some menstrual activity.SubtypesThere are two subtypes of AN:Binge-eating/purging type: patients with anorexia could show binge eating and purging behavior. It is different from bulimia nervosa in terms of the individuals weight. An individual with binge-eating/purging type anorexia is usually significantly underweight. People with bulimia nervosa on the other hand can sometimes be normal-weight or overweight.Restricting type: the individual uses restricting food intake fasting diet pills or exercise as a means for losing weight; they may exercise excessively to keep off weight or prevent weight gain and some individuals eat only enough to stay alive. In the restrictive type there are no recurrent episodes of binge-eating or purging present.Levels of severityBody mass index (BMI) is used by the DSM-5 as an indicator of the level of severity of anorexia nervosa. The DSM-5 states these as follows:Mild: BMI of greater than 17Moderate: BMI of 16–16.99Severe: BMI of 15–15.99Extreme: BMI of less than 15InvestigationsMedical tests to check for signs of physical deterioration in anorexia nervosa may be performed by a general physician or psychiatrist including:Complete blood count (CBC): a test of the white blood cells red blood cells and platelets used to assess the presence of various disorders such as leukocytosis leukopenia thrombocytosis and anemia which may result from malnutrition.Urinalysis: a variety of tests performed on the urine used in the diagnosis of medical disorders to test for substance abuse and as an indicator of overall healthChem-20: Chem-20 also known as SMA-20 a group of twenty separate chemical tests performed on blood serum. Tests include protein and electrolytes such as potassium chlorine and sodium and tests specific to liver and kidney function.Glucose tolerance test: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) used to assess the bodys ability to metabolize glucose. Can be useful in detecting various disorders such as diabetes an insulinoma Cushings Syndrome hypoglycemia and polycystic ovary syndrome.Lipid profile: includes cholesterol (including total cholesterol HDL and LDL) and triglycerides.Serum cholinesterase test: a test of liver enzymes (acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase) useful as a test of liver function and to assess the effects of malnutrition.Liver Function Test: A series of tests used to assess liver function some of the tests are also used in the assessment of malnutrition protein deficiency kidney function bleeding disorders and Crohns Disease.Luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH): Tests the pituitary glands response to GnRh a hormone produced in the hypothalamus. Hypogonadism is often seen in anorexia nervosa cases.Creatine kinase (CK) test: measures the circulating blood levels of creatine kinase an enzyme found in the heart (CK-MB) brain (CK-BB) and skeletal muscle (CK-MM).Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test: urea nitrogen is the byproduct of protein metabolism first formed in the liver then removed from the body by the kidneys. The BUN test is primarily used to test kidney function. A low BUN level may indicate the effects of malnutrition.BUN-to-creatinine ratio: A BUN to creatinine ratio is used to predict various conditions. A high BUN/creatinine ratio can occur in severe hydration acute kidney failure congestive heart failure and intestinal bleeding. A low BUN/creatinine ratio can indicate a low protein diet celiac disease rhabdomyolysis or cirrhosis of the liver.Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): measures electrical activity of the heart. It can be used to detect various disorders such as hyperkalemia.Electroencephalogram (EEG): measures the electrical activity of the brain. It can be used to detect abnormalities such as those associated with pituitary tumors.Thyroid function tests: tests used to assess thyroid functioning by checking levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).Differential diagnosesA variety of medical and psychological conditions have been misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa; in some cases the correct diagnosis was not made for more than ten years.The distinction between binge purging anorexia bulimia nervosa and Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (OSFED) is often difficult for non-specialist clinicians. A main factor differentiating binge-purge anorexia from bulimia is the gap in physical weight. Patients with bulimia nervosa are ordinarily at a healthy weight or slightly overweight. Patients with binge-purge anorexia are commonly underweight. Moreover patients with the binge-purging subtype may be significantly underweight and typically do not binge-eat large amounts of food. In contrast those with bulimia nervosa tend to binge large amounts of food. It is not unusual for patients with an eating disorder to ""move through"" various diagnoses as their behavior and beliefs change over time.TreatmentThere is no conclusive evidence that any particular treatment for anorexia nervosa works better than others.Treatment for anorexia nervosa tries to address three main areas.Restoring the person to a healthy weight;Treating the psychological disorders related to the illness;Reducing or eliminating behaviors or thoughts that originally led to the disordered eating.In some clinical settings a specific body image intervention is performed to reduce body dissatisfaction and body image disturbance. Although restoring the persons weight is the primary task at hand optimal treatment also includes and monitors behavioral change in the individual as well. There is some evidence that hospitalization might adversely affect long term outcome but sometimes is necessary. Psychotherapy for individuals with AN is challenging as they may value being thin and may seek to maintain control and resist change. Initially developing a desire to change is fundamental. Despite no evidence for better treatment in adults patients research stated that family based therapy is the primary choice for adolescents with AN.TherapyFamily-based treatment (FBT) has been shown to be more successful than individual therapy for adolescents with AN. Various forms of family-based treatment have been proven to work in the treatment of adolescent AN including conjoint family therapy (CFT) in which the parents and child are seen together by the same therapist and separated family therapy (SFT) in which the parents and child attend therapy separately with different therapists. Proponents of family therapy for adolescents with AN assert that it is important to include parents in the adolescents treatment.A four- to five-year follow up study of the Maudsley family therapy an evidence-based manualized model showed full recovery at rates up to 90%. Although this model is recommended by the NIMH critics claim that it has the potential to create power struggles in an intimate relationship and may disrupt equal partnerships. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is useful in adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa. One of the most known psychotherapy in the field is CBT-E an enhanced cognitive-behavior therapy specifically focus to eating disorder psychopathology. Acceptance and commitment therapy is a third-wave cognitive-behavioral therapy which has shown promise in the treatment of AN. Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is also used in treating anorexia nervosa.  Schema-Focused Therapy (a form of CBT) was developed by Dr. Jeffrey Young and is effective in helping patients identify origins and triggers for disordered eating.DietDiet is the most essential factor to work on in people with anorexia nervosa and must be tailored to each persons needs. Food variety is important when establishing meal plans as well as foods that are higher in energy density. People must consume adequate calories starting slowly and increasing at a measured pace. Evidence of a role for zinc supplementation during refeeding is unclear.MedicationPharmaceuticals have limited benefit for anorexia itself. There is a lack of good information from which to make recommendations concerning the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating anorexia. Administration of olanzapine has been shown to result in a modest but statistically significant increase in body weight of anorexia nervosa patients.Admission to hospitalPatients with AN may be deemed to have a lack of insight regarding the necessity of treatment and thus may be involuntarily treated without their consent.: 1038  AN has a high mortality and patients admitted in a severely ill state to medical units are at particularly high risk. Diagnosis can be challenging risk assessment may not be performed accurately consent and the need for compulsion may not be assessed appropriately refeeding syndrome may be missed or poorly treated and the behavioural and family problems in AN may be missed or poorly managed. Guidelines published by the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommend that medical and psychiatric experts work together in managing severely ill people with AN.Refeeding syndromeThe rate of refeeding can be difficult to establish because the fear of refeeding syndrome (RFS) can lead to underfeeding.  It is thought that RFS with falling phosphate and potassium levels  is more likely to occur when BMI is very low and when medical comorbidities such as infection or cardiac failure are present.  In those circumstances it is recommended to start refeeding slowly but to build up rapidly as long as RFS does not occur.  Recommendations on energy requirements vary from 5–10 kcal/kg/day in the most medically compromised patients who appear to have the highest risk of RFS to 1900 kcal/day.Experience of treatmentPatients involved in treatment sometimes felt that treatment focused on biological aspects of body weight and eating behaviour change rather than their perceptions or emotional state.: 8  Patients felt that a therapists trust in them shown by being treated as a complete person with their own capacities was significant.: 9  Some patients defined recovery from AN in terms of reclaiming a lost identity.: 10 Healthcare workers involved in the treatment of anorexia reported frustration and anger to set backs in treatment and noncompliance and were afraid of patients dying. Some healthcare workers felt that they did not understand the treatment and that medical doctors were making decisions.: 11  They may feel powerless to improve a patients situation and deskilled as a result.: 12  Healthcare workers involved in monitoring patients consumption of food felt watched themselves.: 12  Healthcare workers often feel a degree of moral dissonance of not being in control of outcomes which they may protect against by focusing on individual tasks avoiding identifying with patients (for example by making their eating behavior very different and not sharing personal information with patients) and blaming patients for their distress.: 1314  Healthcare workers would inflexibly follow process to avoid responsibility.: 13  Healthcare workers attempted to reach balance by gradually giving patients back control avoiding feeling sole responsibility for outcomes being mindful of their emotional state and trying to view eating disorders as external from patients.: 13PrognosisAN has the highest mortality rate of any psychological disorder. The mortality rate is 11 to 12 times greater than in the general population and the suicide risk is 56 times higher. Half of women with AN achieve a full recovery while an additional 20–30% may partially recover. Not all people with anorexia recover completely: about 20% develop anorexia nervosa as a chronic disorder. If anorexia nervosa is not treated serious complications such as heart conditions and kidney failure can arise and eventually lead to death.  The average number of years from onset to remission of AN is seven for women and three for men. After ten to fifteen years 70% of people no longer meet the diagnostic criteria but many still continue to have eating-related problems.Alexithymia (inability to identify and describe ones own emotions) influences treatment outcome. Recovery is also viewed on a spectrum rather than black and white. According to the Morgan-Russell criteria individuals can have a good intermediate or poor outcome. Even when a person is classified as having a ""good"" outcome weight only has to be within 15% of average and normal menstruation must be present in females. The good outcome also excludes psychological health. Recovery for people with anorexia nervosa is undeniably positive but recovery does not mean a return to normal.ComplicationsAnorexia nervosa can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth pubertal maturation or the attainment of peak bone mass. Complications specific to adolescents and children with anorexia nervosa can include the following:Growth retardation may occur as height gain may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases provided that growth potential is preserved height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years) as hypogonadism may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. In some cases especially where onset is before puberty complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.Anorexia nervosa causes alterations in the female reproductive system; significant weight loss as well as psychological stress and intense exercise typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system preventing ovulation. Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotropins in people with anorexia nervosa has been documented. Typically growth hormone (GH) levels are high but levels of IGF-1 the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of ""resistance"" to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute to a loss of bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Anorexia nervosa can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty low bone mass may be permanent.Hepatic steatosis or fatty infiltration of the liver can also occur and is an indicator of malnutrition in children. Neurological disorders that may occur as complications include seizures and tremors. Wernicke encephalopathy which results from vitamin B1 deficiency has been reported in patients who are extremely malnourished; symptoms include confusion problems with the muscles responsible for eye movements and abnormalities in walking gait.The most common gastrointestinal complications of anorexia nervosa are delayed stomach emptying and constipation but also include elevated liver function tests diarrhea acute pancreatitis heartburn difficulty swallowing and rarely superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Delayed stomach emptying or gastroparesis often develops following food restriction and weight loss; the most common symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety fullness nausea and vomiting. The symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods using liquid nutritional supplements or using metoclopramide to increase emptying of food from the stomach. Gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained.Cardiac complicationsAnorexia nervosa increases the risk of sudden cardiac death though the precise cause is unknown. Cardiac complications include structural and functional changes to the heart. Some of these cardiovascular changes are mild and are reversible with treatment while others may be life-threatening. Cardiac complications can include arrhythmias abnormally slow heart beat low blood pressure decreased size of the heart muscle reduced heart volume mitral valve prolapse myocardial fibrosis and pericardial effusion.Abnormalities in conduction and repolarization of the heart that can result from anorexia nervosa include QT prolongation increased QT dispersion conduction delays  and junctional escape rhythms. Electrolyte abnormalities particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can cause anomalies in the electrical activity of the heart and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Hypokalemia most commonly results in patients with anorexia when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing weakness and cognitive impairment and may result in fainting or near-fainting. Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization.  Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased ability to pump blood a reduction in the ability to sustain exercise a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise and a subjective feeling of fatigue.Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain and the heart normalizes in size over weeks to months with recovery. Atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding it is possible that it may cause permanent microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2–4 percent. It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death but it has not been proven to be causative either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.RelapseRates of relapse after treatment range from 9–52% with many studies reporting a relapse rate of at least 25%. Relapse occurs in approximately a third of people in hospital and is greatest in the first six to eighteen months after release from an institution.EpidemiologyAnorexia is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life. About 0.4% of young females are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur three to ten times less commonly in males. Rates in most of the developing world are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. Medical students are a high risk group with an overall estimated prevalence of 10.4% globally.The lifetime rate of atypical anorexia nervosa a form of ED-NOS in which the person loses a significant amount of weight and is at risk for serious medical complications despite having a higher body-mass index is much higher at 5–12%.While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. Most studies show that since at least 1970 the incidence of AN in adult women is fairly constant while there is some indication that the incidence may have been increasing for girls aged between 14 and 20.UnderrepresentationEating disorders are less reported in preindustrial non-westernized countries than in Western countries. In Africa not including South Africa the only data presenting information about eating disorders occurs in case reports and isolated studies not studies investigating prevalence. Western countries experience slightly higher rates of eating disorders than non-western countries. Theories to explain these lower rates of eating disorders lower reporting and lower research rates in include the effects of westernisation and culture change.Men (and women) who might otherwise be diagnosed with anorexia may not meet the DSM-IV criteria for BMI since they have muscle weight but have very little fat. In many cases a subclinical ""not otherwise specified"" diagnosis is made instead; ED-NOS in the DSM-IV and other specified feeding or eating disorder or unspecified feeding or eating disorder in the DSM-5. ED-NOS was the most diagnosed eating disorder in 2009 and it was also shown that AN did not differ significantly in eating pathology or general psychopathology from EDNOS involving restrictive eating.The elderly population is increasingly experiencing anorexia nervosa which has been termed the ""Anorexia of Aging"". The eating disorder is similar to that of typical anorexia nervosa but is more often accompanied by the overuse of laxatives in order to purge the individual of ingested food. Most geriatric anorexia patients limit their food intake to dairy or grains whereas an adolescent anorexic has a more general limitation.This eating disorder that affects older adults has two types - early onset and late onset. Early onset refers to a recurrence of anorexia in late life in an individual who experienced the disease during their youth. Late onset describes instances where the eating disorder begins for the first time late in life. The stimulus for anorexia in elderly patients is typically a loss of control over their lives which can be brought on by many events including moving into an assisted living facility. This is also a time when most older individuals experience a rise in conflict with family members such as limitations on driving or limitations on personal freedom which increases the likelihood of an issue with anorexia. There can be physical issues in the elderly that leads to anorexia of aging including a decline in chewing ability a decline in taste and smell and a decrease in appetite. Psychological reasons for the elderly to develop anorexia can include depression and bereavement and even an indirect attempt at suicide. There are also common comorbid psychiatric conditions with aging anorexics including major depression anxiety disorder obsessive compulsive disorder bipolar disorder schizophrenia and dementia.The signs and symptoms that go along with anorexia of aging are similar to what is observed in adolescent anorexia including sudden weight loss unexplained hair loss or dental problems and a desire to eat alone.There are also several medical conditions that can result from anorexia in the elderly. An increased risk of illness and death can be a result of anorexia. There is also a decline in muscle and bone mass as a result of a reduction in protein intake during anorexia. Another result of anorexia in the aging population is irreparable damage to kidneys heart or colon and an imbalance of electrolytes.Many assessments are available to diagnose anorexia in the aging community. These assessments include the Simplified Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) and Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT). Specific to the geriatric populace the interRAI system identifies detrimental conditions in assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Even a simple screening for nutritional insufficiencies such as low levels of important vitamins can help to identify someone who has anorexia of aging.Anorexia in the elderly should be identified by the retirement communities but is often overlooked especially in patients with dementia. Some studies report that malnutrition is prevalent in nursing homes with up to 58% of residents suffering from it which can lead to the difficulty of identifying anorexia. One of the challenges with assisted living facilities is that they often serve bland monotonous food which lessens residents desire to eat.The treatment for anorexia of aging is undifferentiated as anorexia for any other age group. Some of the treatment options include outpatient and inpatient facilities antidepressant medication and behavioral therapy such as meal observation and discussing eating habits.Male and female athletes are often overlooked as anorexic. Research emphasizes the importance to take athletes diet weight and symptoms into account when diagnosing anorexia instead of just looking at weight and BMI. For athletes ritualized activities such as weigh-ins place emphasis on gaining and losing large amounts of weight which may promote the development of eating disorders among them. While women use diet pills which is an indicator of unhealthy behavior and an eating disorder men use steroids which contextualizes the beauty ideals for genders. In a Canadian study 4% of boys in grade nine used anabolic steroids. Anorexic men are sometimes referred to as manorexic.HistoryThe history of anorexia nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting dating from the Hellenistic era and continuing into the medieval period. The medieval practice of self-starvation by women including some young women in the name of religious piety and purity also concerns anorexia nervosa; it is sometimes referred to as anorexia mirabilis. The earliest medical descriptions of anorexic illnesses are generally credited to English physician Richard Morton in 1689. Case descriptions fitting anorexic illnesses continued throughout the 17th 18th and 19th centuries.The term ""anorexia nervosa"" was coined in 1873 by Sir William Gull one of Queen Victorias personal physicians. Gull published a seminal paper providing a number of detailed case descriptions of patients with anorexia nervosa. In the same year French physician Ernest-Charles Lasègue similarly published details of a number of cases in a paper entitled De lAnorexie hystérique.In the late 19th century anorexia nervosa became widely accepted by the medical profession as a recognized condition. Awareness of the condition was largely limited to the medical profession until the latter part of the 20th century when German-American psychoanalyst Hilde Bruch published The Golden Cage: the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa in 1978. Despite major advances in neuroscience Bruchs theories tend to dominate popular thinking. A further important event was the death of the popular singer and drummer Karen Carpenter in 1983 which prompted widespread ongoing media coverage of eating disorders.See alsoBody image disturbanceBody imageEating recoveryEvolutionary psychiatryIdée fixeInediaList of people with anorexia nervosaNational Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated DisordersOrthorexia nervosaPro-anaReferencesFurther readingExternal linksNational Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated DisordersSociety of Clinical Psychology—Anorexia"
13,"Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It can occur in four forms: skin lungs intestinal and injection. Symptom onset occurs between one day and more than two months after the infection is contracted. The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center. The inhalation form presents with fever chest pain and shortness of breath. The intestinal form presents with diarrhea (which may contain blood) abdominal pains nausea and vomiting. The injection form presents with fever and an abscess at the site of drug injection.According to the Centers for Disease Control the first clinical descriptions of cutaneous anthrax were given by Maret in 1752 and Fournier in 1769. Before that anthrax had been described only through historical accounts. The Prussian scientist Robert Koch (1843–1910) was the first to identify Bacillus anthracis as the bacterium that causes anthrax.Anthrax is spread by contact with the bacteriums spores which often appear in infectious animal products. Contact is by breathing or eating or through an area of broken skin. It does not typically spread directly between people. Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products travelers and military personnel. Diagnosis can be confirmed by finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site.Anthrax vaccination is recommended for people at high risk of infection. Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred. A two-month course of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin levofloxacin and doxycycline after exposure can also prevent infection. If infection occurs treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin. The type and number of antibiotics used depend on the type of infection. Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection.A rare disease human anthrax is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia. It also occurs more regularly in Southern Europe than elsewhere on the continent and is uncommon in Northern Europe and North America. Globally at least 2000 cases occur a year with about two cases a year in the United States. Skin infections represent more than 95% of cases. Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 23.7%. For intestinal infection the risk of death is 25 to 75% while respiratory anthrax has a mortality of 50 to 80% even with treatment. Until the 20th century anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and animals each year. Anthrax has been developed as a weapon by a number of countries. In herbivorous animals infection occurs when they eat or breathe in the spores while grazing. Animals may become infected by killing and/or eating infected animals.EtymologyThe English name comes from anthrax (ἄνθραξ) the Greek word for coal possibly having Egyptian etymology because of the characteristic black skin lesions developed by people with a cutaneous anthrax infection. The central black eschar surrounded by vivid red skin has long been recognised as typical of the disease. The first recorded use of the word ""anthrax"" in English is in a 1398 translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus work De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things 1240).Anthrax was historically known by a wide variety of names indicating its symptoms location and groups considered most vulnerable to infection. They included Siberian plague Cumberland disease charbon splenic fever malignant edema woolsorters disease and la maladie de Bradford.Signs and symptomsSkinCutaneous anthrax also known as hide-porters disease is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It is the most common form (>90% of anthrax cases). It is the least dangerous form (low mortality with treatment 23.7% mortality without). Cutaneous anthrax presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar). The black eschar often shows up as a large painless necrotic ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike bruises or most other lesions cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected reddened swollen and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon and falls off in a few weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin. This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products.InjectionIn December 2009 an outbreak of anthrax occurred among injecting heroin users in the Glasgow and Stirling areas of Scotland resulting in 14 deaths. The source of the anthrax is believed to have been dilution of the heroin with bone meal in Afghanistan. Injected anthrax may have symptoms similar to cutaneous anthrax and may also cause infection deep into the muscle and spread faster.LungsInhalation anthrax usually develops within a week after exposure but may take up to 2 months. During the first few days of illness most people have fever chills and fatigue. These symptoms may be accompanied by cough shortness of breath chest pain and nausea or vomiting making inhalation anthrax difficult to distinguish from influenza and community-acquired pneumonia. This is often described as the prodromal period.Over the next day or so shortness of breath cough and chest pain become more common and complaints not involving the chest such as nausea vomiting altered mental status sweats and headache develop in one-third or more of people. Upper respiratory tract symptoms occur in only a quarter of people and muscle pains are rare. Altered mental status or shortness of breath generally brings people to healthcare and marks the fulminant phase of illness.It infects the lymph nodes in the chest first rather than the lungs themselves a condition called hemorrhagic mediastinitis causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity thereby causing shortness of breath. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly within hours or days after the first stage. Symptoms include high fever extreme shortness of breath shock and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases.GastrointestinalGastrointestinal (GI) infection is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by diarrhea potentially with blood abdominal pains acute inflammation of the intestinal tract and loss of appetite. Occasional vomiting of blood can occur. Lesions have been found in the intestines and in the mouth and throat. After the bacterium invades the gastrointestinal system it spreads to the bloodstream and throughout the body while continuing to make toxins.CauseBacteriaBacillus anthracis is a rod-shaped Gram-positive facultative anaerobic bacterium about 1 by 9 μm in size. It was shown to cause disease by Robert Koch in 1876 when he took a blood sample from an infected cow isolated the bacteria and put them into a mouse. The bacterium normally rests in spore form in the soil and can survive for decades in this state. Herbivores are often infected while grazing especially when eating rough irritant or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the GI tract permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues. Once ingested or placed in an open wound the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics where the bacteria multiply.The production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence and by the dark nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices. Most anthrax bacteria inside the body after death are outcompeted and destroyed by anaerobic bacteria within minutes to hours post mortem. However anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or through the opening of the carcass may form hardy spores. These vegetative bacteria are not contagious. One spore forms per one vegetative bacterium. The triggers for spore formation are not yet known though oxygen tension and lack of nutrients may play roles. Once formed these spores are very hard to eradicate.The infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally begins with inhaled spores being transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells (macrophages) in the lungs and are transported through small vessels (lymphatics) to the lymph nodes in the central chest cavity (mediastinum). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. Once in the lymph nodes the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the bloodstream these bacilli release three proteins named lethal factor edema factor and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans. Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin respectively. These toxins are the primary agents of tissue destruction bleeding and death of the host. If antibiotics are administered too late even if the antibiotics eradicate the bacteria some hosts still die of toxemia because the toxins produced by the bacilli remain in their systems at lethal dose levels.ExposureThe spores of anthrax are able to survive in harsh conditions for decades or even centuries. Such spores can be found on all continents including Antarctica. Disturbed grave sites of infected animals have been known to cause infection after 70 years.Historically inhalational anthrax was called woolsorters disease because it was an occupational hazard for people who sorted wool. Today this form of infection is extremely rare in advanced nations as almost no infected animals remain.Occupational exposure to infected animals or their products (such as skin wool and meat) is the usual pathway of exposure for humans. Workers who are exposed to dead animals and animal products are at the highest risk especially in countries where anthrax is more common. Anthrax in livestock grazing on open range where they mix with wild animals still occasionally occurs in the United States and elsewhere.Many workers who deal with wool and animal hides are routinely exposed to low levels of anthrax spores but most exposure levels are not sufficient to develop anthrax infections. A lethal infection is reported to result from inhalation of about 10000–20000 spores though this dose varies among host species. Little documented evidence is available to verify the exact or average number of spores needed for infection.Mode of infectionAnthrax can enter the human body through the intestines (ingestion) lungs (inhalation) or skin (cutaneous) and causes distinct clinical symptoms based on its site of entry. In general an infected human is quarantined. However anthrax does not usually spread from an infected human to an uninfected human. If the disease is fatal to the persons body though its mass of anthrax bacilli becomes a potential source of infection to others and special precautions should be used to prevent further contamination. Inhalational anthrax if left untreated until obvious symptoms occur is usually fatal.Anthrax can be contracted in laboratory accidents or by handling infected animals their wool or their hides. It has also been used in biological warfare agents and by terrorists to intentionally infect as exemplified by the 2001 anthrax attacks.MechanismThe lethality of the anthrax disease is due to the bacteriums two principal virulence factors: the poly-D-glutamic acid capsule which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by host neutrophils and the tripartite protein toxin called anthrax toxin. Anthrax components: protective antigen (PA) edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). PA plus LF produces lethal toxin and PA plus EF produces edema toxin. These toxins cause death and tissue swelling (edema) respectively.To enter the cells the edema and lethal factors use another protein produced by B. anthracis called protective antigen which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell protease then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA20 and PA63. PA20 dissociates into the extracellular medium playing no further role in the toxic cycle. PA63 then oligomerizes with six other PA63 fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs forming a resistant complex. Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol. It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.Edema factor is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP) and pyrophosphate. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with calmodulin removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling thus inhibiting the immune response. To be specific LF inactivates neutrophils (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make TNF-alpha and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a cytokine whose primary role is to regulate immune cells as well as to induce inflammation and apoptosis or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1 beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to septic shock and death. However recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serous cavities such as the pericardial cavity pleural cavity and peritoneal cavity lymph vessels and blood vessels causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells and ultimately hypovolemic shock and septic shock.DiagnosisVarious techniques may be used for the direct identification of B. anthracis in clinical material. Firstly specimens may be Gram stained. Bacillus spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4 μm long) they may grow in long chains and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is B. anthracis rapid diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction-based assays and immunofluorescence microscopy may be used.All Bacillus species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate B. anthracis from contaminated specimens and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. Bacillus spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35 °C in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO2. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO2. B. anthracis colonies are medium-large gray flat and irregular with swirling projections often referred to as having a ""medusa head"" appearance and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile susceptible to penicillin and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify B. anthracis includes gamma bacteriophage testing indirect hemagglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies. The best confirmatory precipitation test for anthrax is the Ascoli test.PreventionPrecautions are taken to avoid contact with the skin and any fluids exuded through natural body openings of a deceased body that is suspected of harboring anthrax. The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample is collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an approved laboratory to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. The body should be sealed in an airtight body bag and incinerated to prevent the transmission of anthrax spores. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli usually in very large numbers in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic though the culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others.Protective impermeable clothing and equipment such as rubber gloves rubber apron and rubber boots with no perforations are used when handling the body. No skin especially if it has any wounds or scratches should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable but if not available decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Used disposable equipment is burned and/or buried after use. All contaminated bedding or clothing is isolated in double plastic bags and treated as biohazard waste. Respiratory equipment capable of filtering small particles such the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health- and Mine Safety and Health Administration-approved high-efficiency respirator is worn.VaccinesVaccines against anthrax for use in livestock and humans have had a prominent place in the history of medicine. The French scientist Louis Pasteur developed the first effective vaccine in 1881. Human anthrax vaccines were developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s and in the US and UK in the 1950s. The current FDA-approved US vaccine was formulated in the 1960s.Currently administered human anthrax vaccines include acellular (United States) and live vaccine (Russia) varieties. All currently used anthrax vaccines show considerable local and general reactogenicity (erythema induration soreness fever) and serious adverse reactions occur in about 1% of recipients. The American product BioThrax is licensed by the FDA and was formerly administered in a six-dose primary series at 0 2 4 weeks and 6 12 18 months with annual boosters to maintain immunity. In 2008 the FDA approved omitting the week-2 dose resulting in the currently recommended five-dose series. New second-generation vaccines currently being researched include recombinant live vaccines and recombinant subunit vaccines. In the 20th century the use of a modern product (BioThrax) to protect American troops against the use of anthrax in biological warfare was controversial.AntibioticsPreventive antibiotics are recommended in those who have been exposed. Early detection of sources of anthrax infection can allow preventive measures to be taken. In response to the anthrax attacks of October 2001 the United States Postal Service (USPS) installed biodetection systems (BDSs) in their large-scale mail processing facilities. BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire police hospitals and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax response actions and prophylactic medication. Because of the time delay inherent in getting final verification that anthrax has been used prophylactic antibiotic treatment of possibly exposed personnel must be started as soon as possible.TreatmentAnthrax cannot be spread from person to person except in the rare case of skin exudates from cutaneous anthrax. However a persons clothing and body may be contaminated with anthrax spores. Effective decontamination of people can be accomplished by a thorough wash-down with antimicrobial soap and water. Wastewater is treated with bleach or another antimicrobial agent. Effective decontamination of articles can be accomplished by boiling them in water for 30 minutes or longer. Chlorine bleach is ineffective in destroying spores and vegetative cells on surfaces though formaldehyde is effective. Burning clothing is very effective in destroying spores. After decontamination there is no need to immunize treat or isolate contacts of persons ill with anthrax unless they were also exposed to the same source of infection.AntibioticsEarly antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential; delay significantly lessens chances for survival. Treatment for anthrax infection and other bacterial infections includes large doses of intravenous and oral antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) doxycycline erythromycin vancomycin or penicillin. FDA-approved agents include ciprofloxacin doxycycline and penicillin. In possible cases of pulmonary anthrax early antibiotic prophylaxis treatment is crucial to prevent possible death. Many attempts have been made to develop new drugs against anthrax but existing drugs are effective if treatment is started soon enough.Monoclonal antibodiesIn May 2009 Human Genome Sciences submitted a biologic license application (BLA permission to market) for its new drug raxibacumab (brand name ABthrax) intended for emergency treatment of inhaled anthrax. On 14 December 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax. Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes toxins produced by B. anthracis. In March 2016 FDA approved a second anthrax treatment using a monoclonal antibody which neutralizes the toxins produced by B. anthracis. Obiltoxaximab is approved to treat inhalational anthrax in conjunction with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prevention when alternative therapies are not available or appropriate.PrognosisCutaneous anthrax is rarely fatal if treated because the infection area is limited to the skin preventing the lethal factor edema factor and protective antigen from entering and destroying a vital organ. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death.Before 2001 fatality rates for inhalation anthrax were 90%; since then they have fallen to 45%. People that progress to the fulminant phase of inhalational anthrax nearly always die with one case study showing a death rate of 97%. Anthrax meningoencephalitis is also nearly always fatal.GI infections can be treated but usually result in fatality rates of 25% to 60% depending upon how soon treatment commences. This form of anthrax is the rarest.EpidemiologyGlobally at least 2000 cases occur a year.United StatesThe last fatal case of natural inhalational anthrax in the United States occurred in California in 1976 when a home weaver died after working with infected wool imported from Pakistan. To minimize the chance of spreading the disease the body was transported to UCLA in a sealed plastic body bag within a sealed metal container for autopsy.Gastrointestinal anthrax is exceedingly rare in the United States with only two cases on record. The first case was reported in 1942 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During December 2009 the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a case of gastrointestinal anthrax in an adult female.In 2007 two cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported in Danbury Connecticut. The case involved the maker of traditional African-style drums who was working with a goat hide purchased from a dealer in New York City which had been previously cleared by Customs. While the hide was being scraped a spider bite led to the spores entering the bloodstream. His son also became infected.The CDC investigated the source of the December 2009 infection and the possibility that it was contracted from an African drum recently used by the woman taking part in a drum circle. The woman apparently inhaled anthrax in spore form from the hide of the drum. She became critically ill but with gastrointestinal anthrax rather than inhaled anthrax which made her unique in American medical history. The building where the infection took place was cleaned and reopened to the public and the woman recovered. The New Hampshire state epidemiologist Jodie Dionne-Odom stated ""It is a mystery. We really dont know why it happened.""CroatiaIn July 2022 dozens of cattle in a nature park in Lonjsko Polje a flood plain by the Sava river died of anthrax and 6 people have been hospitalized with light skin-related symptoms.United KingdomIn November 2008 a drum maker in the United Kingdom who worked with untreated animal skins died from anthrax. In December 2009 an outbreak of anthrax occurred among heroin addicts in the Glasgow and Stirling areas of Scotland resulting in 14 deaths. The source of the anthrax is believed to have been dilution of the heroin with bone meal in Afghanistan.HistoryDiscoveryRobert Koch a German physician and scientist first identified the bacterium that caused the anthrax disease in 1875 in Wollstein (now Wolsztyn - a town in Poland). His pioneering work in the late 19th century was one of the first demonstrations that diseases could be caused by microbes. In a groundbreaking series of experiments he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax. His experiments not only helped create an understanding of anthrax but also helped elucidate the role of microbes in causing illness at a time when debates still took place over spontaneous generation versus cell theory. Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.Although Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to understanding anthrax other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain where anthrax affected workers in the wool worsted hides and tanning industries it was viewed with fear. John Henry Bell a doctor born & based in Bradford first made the link between the mysterious and deadly ""woolsorters disease"" and anthrax showing in 1878 that they were one and the same. In the early 20th century Friederich Wilhelm Eurich the German bacteriologist who settled in Bradford with his family as a child carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board. Eurich also made valuable contributions to a Home Office Departmental Committee of Inquiry established in 1913 to address the continuing problem of industrial anthrax. His work in this capacity much of it collaboration with the factory inspector G. Elmhirst Duckering led directly to the Anthrax Prevention Act (1919).First vaccinationAnthrax posed a major economic challenge in France and elsewhere during the 19th century. Horses cattle and sheep were particularly vulnerable and national funds were set aside to investigate the production of a vaccine. French scientist Louis Pasteur was charged with the production of a vaccine following his successful work in developing methods that helped to protect the important wine and silk industries.In May 1881 Pasteur – in collaboration with his assistants Jean-Joseph Henri Toussaint Émile Roux and others – performed a public experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort to demonstrate his concept of vaccination. He prepared two groups of 25 sheep one goat and several cattle. The animals of one group were injected with an anthrax vaccine prepared by Pasteur twice at an interval of 15 days; the control group was left unvaccinated. Thirty days after the first injection both groups were injected with a culture of live anthrax bacteria. All the animals in the unvaccinated group died while all of the animals in the vaccinated group survived.After this apparent triumph which was widely reported in the local national and international press Pasteur made strenuous efforts to export the vaccine beyond France. He used his celebrity status to establish Pasteur Institutes across Europe and Asia and his nephew Adrien Loir travelled to Australia in 1888 to try to introduce the vaccine to combat anthrax in New South Wales. Ultimately the vaccine was unsuccessful in the challenging climate of rural Australia and it was soon superseded by a more robust version developed by local researchers John Gunn and John McGarvie Smith.The human vaccine for anthrax became available in 1954. This was a cell-free vaccine instead of the live-cell Pasteur-style vaccine used for veterinary purposes. An improved cell-free vaccine became available in 1970.Engineered strainsThe Sterne strain of anthrax named after the Trieste-born immunologist Max Sterne is an attenuated strain used as a vaccine which contains only the anthrax toxin virulence plasmid and not the polyglutamic acid capsule expressing plasmid.Strain 836 created by the Soviet bioweapons program in the 1980s was later called by the Los Angeles Times ""the most virulent and vicious strain of anthrax known to man"".The virulent Ames strain which was used in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States has received the most news coverage of any anthrax outbreak. The Ames strain contains two virulence plasmids which separately encode for a three-protein toxin called anthrax toxin and a polyglutamic acid capsule.Nonetheless the Vollum strain developed but never used as a biological weapon during the Second World War is much more dangerous. The Vollum (also incorrectly referred to as Vellum) strain was isolated in 1935 from a cow in Oxfordshire. This same strain was used during the Gruinard bioweapons trials. A variation of Vollum known as ""Vollum 1B"" was used during the 1960s in the US and UK bioweapon programs. Vollum 1B is widely believed to have been isolated from William A. Boyles a 46-year-old scientist at the US Army Biological Warfare Laboratories at Camp (later Fort) Detrick Maryland who died in 1951 after being accidentally infected with the Vollum strain.US Air Force researchers have developed a vaccine strain to produce an improved anthrax vaccine which requires a minimal number of injections to achieve and maintain long-term immunity. It is designated as the Alls/Gifford (Curlicue) strain.Society and cultureSite cleanupAnthrax spores can survive for very long periods of time in the environment after release. Chemical methods for cleaning anthrax-contaminated sites or materials may use oxidizing agents such as peroxides ethylene oxide Sandia Foam chlorine dioxide (used in the Hart Senate Office Building) peracetic acid ozone gas hypochlorous acid sodium persulfate and liquid bleach products containing sodium hypochlorite. Nonoxidizing agents shown to be effective for anthrax decontamination include methyl bromide formaldehyde and metam sodium. These agents destroy bacterial spores. All of the aforementioned anthrax decontamination technologies have been demonstrated to be effective in laboratory tests conducted by the US EPA or others.Decontamination techniques for Bacillus anthracis spores are affected by the material with which the spores are associated environmental factors such as temperature and humidity and microbiological factors such as the spore species anthracis strain and test methods used.A bleach solution for treating hard surfaces has been approved by the EPA. Chlorine dioxide has emerged as the preferred biocide against anthrax-contaminated sites having been employed in the treatment of numerous government buildings over the past decade. Its chief drawback is the need for in situ processes to have the reactant on demand.To speed the process trace amounts of a nontoxic catalyst composed of iron and tetroamido macrocyclic ligands are combined with sodium carbonate and bicarbonate and converted into a spray. The spray formula is applied to an infested area and is followed by another spray containing tert-butyl hydroperoxide.Using the catalyst method complete destruction of all anthrax spores can be achieved in under 30 minutes. A standard catalyst-free spray destroys fewer than half the spores in the same amount of time.Cleanups at a Senate Office Building several contaminated postal facilities and other US government and private office buildings a collaborative effort headed by the Environmental Protection Agency showed decontamination to be possible but time-consuming and costly. Clearing the Senate Office Building of anthrax spores cost $27 million according to the Government Accountability Office. Cleaning the Brentwood postal facility in Washington cost $130 million and took 26 months. Since then newer and less costly methods have been developed.Cleanup of anthrax-contaminated areas on ranches and in the wild is much more problematic. Carcasses may be burned though often 3 days are needed to burn a large carcass and this is not feasible in areas with little wood. Carcasses may also be buried though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this while environmentally destructive causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative B. anthracis cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.The experimental site at Gruinard Island is said to have been decontaminated with a mixture of formaldehyde and seawater by the Ministry of Defence. It is not clear whether similar treatments had been applied to US test sites.Biological warfareAnthrax spores have been used as a biological warfare weapon. Its first modern incidence occurred when Nordic rebels supplied by the German General Staff used anthrax with unknown results against the Imperial Russian Army in Finland in 1916. Anthrax was first tested as a biological warfare agent by Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria during the 1930s; some of this testing involved intentional infection of prisoners of war thousands of whom died. Anthrax designated at the time as Agent N was also investigated by the Allies in the 1940s.A long history of practical bioweapons research exists in this area. For example in 1942 British bioweapons trials severely contaminated Gruinard Island in Scotland with anthrax spores of the Vollum-14578 strain making it a no-go area until it was decontaminated in 1990. The Gruinard trials involved testing the effectiveness of a submunition of an ""N-bomb"" –  a biological weapon containing dried anthrax spores. Additionally five million ""cattle cakes"" (animal feed pellets impregnated with anthrax spores) were prepared and stored at Porton Down for ""Operation Vegetarian"" –  anti livestock attacks against Germany to be made by the Royal Air Force. The plan was for anthrax-based biological weapons to be dropped on Germany in 1944. However the edible cattle cakes and the bomb were not used; the cattle cakes were incinerated in late 1945.Weaponized anthrax was part of the US stockpile prior to 1972 when the United States signed the Biological Weapons Convention. President Nixon ordered the dismantling of US biowarfare programs in 1969 and the destruction of all existing stockpiles of bioweapons. In 1978–79 the Rhodesian government used anthrax against cattle and humans during its campaign against rebels. The Soviet Union created and stored 100 to 200 tons of anthrax spores at Kantubek on Vozrozhdeniya Island; they were abandoned in 1992 and destroyed in 2002.American military and British Army personnel are no longer routinely vaccinated against anthrax prior to active service in places where biological attacks are considered a threat.Sverdlovsk incident (2 April 1979)Despite signing the 1972 agreement to end bioweapon production the government of the Soviet Union had an active bioweapons program that included the production of hundreds of tons of anthrax after this period. On 2 April 1979 some of the over one million people living in Sverdlovsk (now called Ekaterinburg Russia) about 1370 kilometres (850 mi) east of Moscow were exposed to an accidental release of anthrax from a biological weapons complex located near there. At least 94 people were infected of whom at least 68 died. One victim died four days after the release 10 over an eight-day period at the peak of the deaths and the last six weeks later. Extensive cleanup vaccinations and medical interventions managed to save about 30 of the victims. Extensive cover-ups and destruction of records by the KGB continued from 1979 until Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted this anthrax accident in 1992. Jeanne Guillemin reported in 1999 that a combined Russian and United States team investigated the accident in 1992.Nearly all of the night-shift workers of a ceramics plant directly across the street from the biological facility (compound 19) became infected and most died. Since most were men some NATO governments suspected the Soviet Union had developed a sex-specific weapon. The government blamed the outbreak on the consumption of anthrax-tainted meat and ordered the confiscation of all uninspected meat that entered the city. They also ordered all stray dogs to be shot and people not have contact with sick animals. Also a voluntary evacuation and anthrax vaccination program was established for people from 18 to 55.To support the cover-up story Soviet medical and legal journals published articles about an outbreak in livestock that caused GI anthrax in people having consumed infected meat and cutaneous anthrax in people having come into contact with the animals. All medical and public health records were confiscated by the KGB. In addition to the medical problems the outbreak caused it also prompted Western countries to be more suspicious of a covert Soviet bioweapons program and to increase their surveillance of suspected sites. In 1986 the US government was allowed to investigate the incident and concluded the exposure was from aerosol anthrax from a military weapons facility. In 1992 President Yeltsin admitted he was ""absolutely certain"" that ""rumors"" about the Soviet Union violating the 1972 Bioweapons Treaty were true. The Soviet Union like the US and UK had agreed to submit information to the UN about their bioweapons programs but omitted known facilities and never acknowledged their weapons program.Anthrax bioterrorismIn theory anthrax spores can be cultivated with minimal special equipment and a first-year collegiate microbiological education.To make large amounts of an aerosol form of anthrax suitable for biological warfare requires extensive practical knowledge training and highly advanced equipment.Concentrated anthrax spores were used for bioterrorism in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States delivered by mailing postal letters containing the spores. The letters were sent to several news media offices and two Democratic senators: Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. As a result 22 were infected and five died. Only a few grams of material were used in these attacks and in August 2008 the US Department of Justice announced they believed that Bruce Ivins a senior biodefense researcher employed by the United States government was responsible. These events also spawned many anthrax hoaxes.Due to these events the US Postal Service installed biohazard detection systems at its major distribution centers to actively scan for anthrax being transported through the mail. As of 2020 no positive alerts by these systems have occurred.Decontaminating mailIn response to the postal anthrax attacks and hoaxes the United States Postal Service sterilized some mail using gamma irradiation and treatment with a proprietary enzyme formula supplied by Sipco Industries.A scientific experiment performed by a high school student later published in the Journal of Medical Toxicology suggested a domestic electric iron at its hottest setting (at least 400 °F (204 °C)) used for at least 5 minutes should destroy all anthrax spores in a common postal envelope.Popular cultureIn Aldous Huxleys 1932 dystopian novel Brave New World anthrax bombs are mentioned as the primary weapon by means of which original modern society is terrorized and in large part eradicated to be replaced by a dystopian society.The climax of the 1947 British film The Loves of Joanna Godden involves the death of a key character by anthrax. Composer Ralph Vaughan Williams provided the affecting mood music for the scene.The episode ""Diagnosis: Danger"" (1963) from the series Alfred Hitchcock Presents concerns Health Department officials working to contain an anthrax outbreak.Anthrax attacks have featured in the storylines of various television episodes and films. A Criminal Minds episode follows the attempt to identify an attacker who released anthrax spores in a public park.The American thrash metal band Anthrax gets its name from the disease.BBC drama Silent Witness follows criminal cases from the perspective of forensic pathologists and forensic scientists. Series 16 episodes 3 and 4 expose a case of genetically modified anthrax.The 2013 book Russian Roulette by Anthony Horowitz contains a young protagonist who is described to have escaped from an anthrax outbreak.In the 2021 film The Power of the Dog directed by Jane Campion and based on the novel by Thomas Savage a key character dies from sepsis caused by anthrax.Other animalsAnthrax is especially rare in dogs and cats as is evidenced by a single reported case in the United States in 2001. Anthrax outbreaks occur in some wild animal populations with some regularity.Russian researchers estimate arctic permafrost contains around 1.5 million anthrax-infected reindeer carcasses and the spores may survive in the permafrost for 105 years. A risk exists that global warming in the Arctic can thaw the permafrost releasing anthrax spores in the carcasses. In 2016 an anthrax outbreak in reindeer was linked to a 75-year-old carcass that defrosted during a heat wave.ReferencesExternal linksAnthrax at CurlieAnthrax in humans and animals – Textbook from WHOScientific American ""Earthworms and Anthrax"" 23-July-1881 pp. 57"
14,"Anticholinergics (anticholinergic agents) are substances that block the action of the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh) at synapses in the central and peripheral nervous system.These agents inhibit the parasympathetic nervous system by selectively blocking the binding of ACh to its receptor in nerve cells. The nerve fibers of the parasympathetic system are responsible for the involuntary movement of smooth muscles present in the gastrointestinal tract urinary tract lungs sweat glands and many other parts of the body.In broad terms anticholinergics are divided into two categories in accordance with their specific targets in the central and peripheral nervous system and at the neuromuscular junction: antimuscarinic agents and antinicotinic agents (ganglionic blockers neuromuscular blockers).The term ""anticholinergic"" is typically used to refer to antimuscarinics which competitively inhibit the binding of ACh to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; such agents do not antagonize the binding at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction although the term is sometimes used to refer to agents which do so.Medical usesAnticholinergic drugs are used to treat a variety of conditions:Dizziness (including vertigo and motion sickness-related symptoms)Extrapyramidal symptoms a potential side-effect of antipsychotic medicationsGastrointestinal disorders (e.g. peptic ulcers diarrhea pylorospasm diverticulitis ulcerative colitis nausea and vomiting)Genitourinary disorders (e.g. cystitis urethritis and prostatitis)Insomnia although usually only on a short-term basisRespiratory disorders (e.g. asthma chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD])Sinus bradycardia due to a hypersensitive vagus nerveOrganophosphate based nerve agent poisoning such as VX sarin tabun and soman (atropine is favoured in conjunction with an oxime usually pralidoxime)Anticholinergics generally have antisialagogue effects (decreasing saliva production) and most produce some level of sedation both being advantageous in surgical procedures.Until the beginning of the 20th century anticholinergic drugs were widely used to treat psychiatric disorders.Physiological effectsDelirium (often with hallucinations and delusions indistinguishable from reality)Ocular symptoms (from eye drops): mydriasis pupil dilation and acute angle-closure glaucoma in those with shallow anterior chamberAnhidrosis dry mouth dry skinFeverConstipationTachycardiaUrinary retentionCutaneous vasodilationClinically the most significant feature is delirium particularly in the elderly who are most likely to be affected by the toxidrome.Side effectsLong-term use may increase the risk of both cognitive and physical decline. It is unclear whether they affect the risk of death generally. However in older adults they do appear to increase the risk of death.Possible effects of anticholinergics include:Possible effects in the central nervous system resemble those associated with delirium and may include:Older patients are at a higher risk of experiencing CNS side effects.ToxicityAn acute anticholinergic syndrome is reversible and subsides once all of the causative agents have been excreted. Reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents such as physostigmine can be used as an antidote in life-threatening cases. Wider use is discouraged due to the significant side effects related to cholinergic excess including seizures muscle weakness bradycardia bronchoconstriction lacrimation salivation bronchorrhea vomiting and diarrhea. Even in documented cases of anticholinergic toxicity seizures have been reported after the rapid administration of physostigmine. Asystole has occurred after physostigmine administration for tricyclic antidepressant overdose so a conduction delay (QRS > 0.10 second) or suggestion of tricyclic antidepressant ingestion is generally considered a contraindication to physostigmine administration.PharmacologyAnticholinergics are classified according to the receptors that are affected:Antimuscarinic agents operate on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The majority of anticholinergic drugs are antimuscarinics.Antinicotinic agents operate on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The majority of these are non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants for surgical use that are structurally related to curare. Several are depolarizing agents.ExamplesExamples of common anticholinergics:Plants of the family Solanaceae contain various anticholinergic tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine atropine and hyoscyamine.Physostigmine is one of only a few drugs that can be used as an antidote for anticholinergic poisoning. Nicotine also counteracts anticholinergics by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Caffeine (although an adenosine receptor antagonist) can counteract the anticholinergic symptoms by reducing sedation and increasing acetylcholine activity thereby causing alertness and arousal.Psychoactive usesWhen a significant amount of an anticholinergic is taken into the body a toxic reaction known as acute anticholinergic syndrome may result. This may happen accidentally or intentionally as a consequence of either recreational or entheogenic drug use though many users find the side effects to be exceedingly unpleasant and not worth the recreational effects they experience. In the context of recreational use anticholinergics are often called deliriants.Plant sourcesThe most common plants containing anticholinergic alkaloids (including atropine scopolamine and hyoscyamine among others) are:Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade)Brugmansia speciesDatura speciesGarrya speciesHyoscyamus niger (henbane)Mandragora officinarum (mandrake)Use as a deterrentSeveral narcotic and opiate-containing drug preparations such as those containing  hydrocodone and codeine are combined with an anticholinergic agent to deter intentional misuse. Examples include Hydromet/Hycodan (hydrocodone/homatropine) Lomotil (diphenoxylate/atropine) and Tussionex (hydrocodone polistirex/chlorpheniramine). However it is noted that opioid/antihistamine combinations are used clinically for their synergistic effect in the management of pain and maintenance of dissociative anesthesia (sedation) in such preparations as Meprozine (meperidine/promethazine) and Diconal (dipipanone/cyclizine) which act as strong anticholinergic agents.== References =="
15,Antisialagogues are drugs or substances that decrease the flow rate of saliva and their effect is opposite to that of sialagogues. Their origin may be both natural and synthetic. Anticholinergics generally have antisialagogue effects and most produce some level of sedation both being advantageous in surgical procedures.Classic antisialagogues include:atropineopiumalkaliesbelladonnahyoscyamusstramoniumtobacco in excessall nauseous or insipid substances.== References ==
16,"Aphthous stomatitis or recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common condition characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers (aphthae) in otherwise healthy individuals. The informal term canker sore is also used mainly in North America although it may also refer to other types of mouth ulcers. The cause is not completely understood but involves a T cell-mediated immune response triggered by a variety of factors which may include nutritional deficiencies local trauma stress hormonal influences allergies genetic predisposition certain foods dehydration some food additives or some hygienic chemical additives like SDS (common in toothpaste).These ulcers occur periodically and heal completely between attacks. In the majority of cases the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth – i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue – although the more severe forms which are less common may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.The condition is very common affecting about 20% of the general population to some degree. The onset is often during childhood or adolescence and the condition usually lasts for several years before gradually disappearing. There is no cure and treatments such as corticosteroids aim to manage pain reduce healing time and reduce the frequency of episodes of ulceration.Signs and symptomsPersons with aphthous stomatitis have no detectable systemic symptoms or signs (i.e. outside the mouth). Generally symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning itching or stinging which may precede the appearance of any lesion by some hours; and pain which is often out of proportion to the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g. if they are acidic or abrasive). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable and ulcers on the soft palate back of the throat or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3–6 times per year. However severe disease is characterized by virtually constant ulceration (new lesions developing before old ones have healed) and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating. In severe cases this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss.Aphthous ulcers typically begin as erythematous macules (reddened flat area of mucosa) which develop into ulcers that are covered with a yellow-grey fibrinous membrane that can be scraped away. A reddish ""halo"" surrounds the ulcer. The size number location healing time and periodicity between episodes of ulcer formation are all dependent upon the subtype of aphthous stomatitis.CausesThe cause is not entirely clear but is thought to be multifactorial. It has been suggested that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought to be the result of a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60 and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.Aphthous stomatitis has been associated with other autoimmune diseases namely systemic lupus erythematosus Behçets disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. However common autoantibodies are not detected in most patients and the condition tends to resolve spontaneously with advancing age rather than worsen.Evidence for the T cell-mediated mechanism of mucosal destruction is strong but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and are thought to be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests that there are a number of possible triggers each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups namely primary immuno-dysregulation decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.ImmunityAt least 40% of people with aphthous stomatitis have a positive family history suggesting that some people are genetically predisposed to developing oral ulceration. HLA-B12 HLA-B51 HLA-Cw7 HLA-A2 HLA-A11 and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition and at an earlier age than is typical.Stress has effects on the immune system which may explain why some cases directly correlate with stress. It is often stated that in studies of students with the condition ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively it has been suggested that oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress and hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.Aphthous-like ulceration also occurs in conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation e.g. cyclic neutropenia and human immunodeficiency virus infection. In cyclic neutropenia more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation and resolution of the underlying neutropenia is associated with healing of the ulcers. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.Mucosal barrierThe thickness of the mucosa may be an important factor in aphthous stomatitis. Usually ulcers form on the thinner non-keratinizing mucosal surfaces in the mouth. Factors which decrease the thickness of the mucosa increase the frequency of occurrence and factors which increase the thickness of the mucosa correlate with decreased ulceration.The nutritional deficiencies associated with aphthous stomatitis (vitamin B12 folate and iron) can all cause a decrease in the thickness of the oral mucosa (atrophy).Local trauma is also associated with aphthous stomatitis and it is known that trauma can decrease the mucosal barrier. Trauma could occur during injections of local anesthetic in the mouth or otherwise during dental treatments frictional trauma from a sharp surface in the mouth such as broken tooth or from tooth brushing.Hormonal factors are capable of altering the mucosal barrier. In one study a small group of females with aphthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period pregnancy or menopause.Aphthous stomatitis is more common in people who smoke and there is also a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smokers keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.Antigenic sensitivityVarious antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger including L forms of streptococci herpes simplex virus varicella-zoster virus adenovirus and cytomegalovirus. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa but without any productive infection. In some persons attacks of ulceration occur at the same time as asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres.In some instances recurrent mouth ulcers may be a manifestation of an allergic reaction. Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g. chocolate coffee strawberries eggs nuts tomatoes cheese citrus fruits benzoates cinnamaldehyde and highly acidic foods) toothpastes and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12–24 hours of exposure.Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) a detergent present in some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It has been shown that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.Systemic diseaseAphthous-like ulceration may occur in association with several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis but this type of oral ulceration is not considered to be true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces in addition to the mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.Behçets disease is a triad of mouth ulcers genital ulcers and anterior uveitis. The main feature of Behçets disease is aphthous-like ulceration but this is usually more severe than seen in aphthous stomatitis without a systemic cause and typically resembles major or herpetiforme ulceration or both. Aphthous-like ulceration is the first sign of the disease in 25–75% of cases. Behçets is more common in individuals whose ethnic origin is from regions along the Silk Road (between the Mediterranean and the Far East). It tends to be rare in other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. MAGIC syndrome is a possible variant of Behçets disease and is associated with aphthous-like ulceration. The name stands for ""mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage"" (relapsing polychondritis).PFAPA syndrome is a rare condition that tends to occur in children. The name stands for ""periodic fever aphthae pharyngitis (sore throat) and cervical adenitis"" (inflammation of the lymph nodes in the neck). The fevers occur periodically about every 3–5 weeks. The condition appears to improve with tonsillectomy or immunosuppression suggesting an immunologic cause.In cyclic neutropenia there is a reduction in the level of circulating neutrophils in the blood that occurs about every 21 days. Opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous-like ulceration is worst during this time.Hematinic deficiencies (vitamin B12 folic acid and iron) occurring singly or in combination and with or without any underlying gastrointestinal disease may be twice as common in people with RAS. However iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency has been the subject of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers have a vitamin B12 deficiency an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.Gastrointestinal disorders are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis e.g. most commonly celiac disease but also inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have celiac disease which usually presents with severe malnutrition anemia abdominal pain diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be the only sign of celiac disease. Despite this association a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.Other examples of systemic conditions associated with aphthous-like ulceration include reactive arthritis and recurrent erythema multiforme.DiagnosisDiagnosis is mostly based on the clinical appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature is a history of recurrent self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes most commonly aphthous stomatitis but rarely Behçets disease erythema multiforme ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.Special investigations may be indicated to rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia deficiencies of iron folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration which is in contrast to aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil) and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.Tissue biopsy is not usually required unless to rule out other suspected conditions such as oral squamous cell carcinoma. The histopathologic appearance is not pathognomonic (the microscopic appearance is not specific to the condition). Early lesions have a central zone of ulceration covered by a fibrinous membrane. In the connective tissue deep to the ulcer there is increased vascularity and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes histiocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The epithelium on the margins of the ulcer shows spongiosis and there are many mononuclear cells in the basal third. There are also lymphocytes and histiocytes in the connective tissue surrounding deeper blood vessels near to the ulcer described histologically as ""perivascular cuffing"".ClassificationAphthous stomatitis has been classified as a type of non-infectious stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth). One classification distinguishes ""common simple aphthae"" accounting for 95% of cases with 3–6 attacks per year rapid healing minimal pain and restriction of ulceration to the mouth; and ""complex aphthae"" accounting for 5% of cases where ulcers may be present on the genital mucosa in addition to mouth healing is slower and pain is more severe. A more common method of classifying aphthous stomatitis is into three variants distinguished by the size number and location of the lesions the healing time of individual ulcers and whether a scar is left after healing (see below).Minor aphthous ulcerationThis is the most common type of aphthous stomatitis accounting for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU) or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10 mm in diameter (usually about 2–3 mm) and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and buccal mucosa lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration there is usually an ulcer-free period of variable length.Major aphthous ulcerationThis subtype makes up about 10% of all cases of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous ulceration (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers but are more than 10 mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days) and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces a greater number of ulcers and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non-keratinized mucosal surfaces but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous ulceration major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.Herpetiform ulcerationHerpetiform ulcers (also termed stomatitis herpetiformis or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis so named because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1 mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.RAS type ulcerationRecurrent oral ulceration associated with systemic conditions is termed ""RAS-type ulceration"" ""RAS-like ulceration"" or ""aphthous-like ulcers"". Aphthous stomatitis occurs in individuals with no associated systemic disease. Persons with certain systemic diseases may be prone to oral ulceration but this is secondary to the underlying medical condition (see the systemic disease section). This kind of ulceration is considered by some to be separate from true aphthous stomatitis. However this definition is not strictly applied. For example many sources refer to oral ulceration caused by anemia and/or nutritional deficiencies as aphthous stomatitis and some also consider Behçets disease to be a variant.TreatmentThe vast majority of people with aphthous stomatitis have minor symptoms and do not require any specific therapy. The pain is often tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of ulceration such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and beverages. Many different topical and systemic medications have been proposed (see table) sometimes showing little or no evidence of usefulness when formally investigated. Some of the results of interventions for RAS may in truth represent a placebo effect. No therapy is curative with treatment aiming to relieve pain promote healing and reduce the frequency of episodes of ulceration.MedicationThe first line of therapy for aphthous stomatitis are topical agents rather than systemic medication with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is usually reserved for severe disease due to the risk of adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.Occasionally in females where ulceration is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills progestogen or a change in birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy for people who have developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example there is some evidence that vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.OtherSurgical excision of aphthous ulcers has been described but it is an ineffective and inappropriate treatment. Silver nitrate has also been used as a chemical cauterant. Apart from the mainstream approaches detailed above there are numerous treatments of unproven effectiveness ranging from herbal remedies to otherwise alternative treatments including Aloe vera Myrtus communis Rosa damascena potassium alum zinc sulfate nicotine polio virus vaccine and prostaglandin E2.PrognosisBy definition there is no serious underlying medical condition and most importantly the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating weight loss may develop as a result of not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.EpidemiologyAphthous stomatitis affects between 5% and 66% of people with about 20% of individuals in most populations having the condition to some degree. This makes it the most common disease of the oral mucosa. Aphthous stomatitis occurs worldwide but is more common in developed countries.Within nations it is more common in higher socioeconomic groups. Males and females are affected in an equal ratio and the peak age of onset between 10 and 19 years. About 80% of people with aphthous stomatitis first developed the condition before the age of 30. There have been reports of ethnic variation. For example in the United States aphthous stomatitis may be three times more common in white-skinned people than black-skinned people.History society and culture""Aphthous affectations"" and ""aphthous ulcerations"" of the mouth are mentioned several times in the treatise ""Of the Epidemics"" (part of the Hippocratic corpus in the 4th century BCE) although it seems likely that this was oral ulceration as a manifestation of some infectious disease since they are described as occurring in epidemic-like patterns with concurrent symptoms such as fever.Aphthous stomatitis was once thought to be a form of recurrent herpes simplex virus infection and some clinicians still refer to the condition as ""herpes"" despite this cause having been disproven.The informal term ""canker sore"" is sometimes used mainly in North America either to describe this condition generally or to refer to the individual ulcers of this condition or mouth ulcers of any cause unrelated to this condition. The origin of the word ""canker"" is thought to have been influenced by Latin Old English Middle English and Old North French. In Latin cancer translates to ""malignant tumor"" or literally ""crab"" (related to the likening of sectioned tumors to the limbs of a crab). The closely related word in Middle English and Old North French chancre now more usually applied to syphilis is also thought to be involved. Despite this etymology aphthous stomatitis is not a form of cancer but rather entirely benign.An aphtha (plural aphthae) is a non specific term that refers to an ulcer of the mouth. The word is derived from the Greek word aphtha meaning ""eruption"" or ""ulcer"". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae including Bednars aphthae (infected traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants) oral candidiasis and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer it has been suggested that the term ""aphthous ulcer"" is redundant but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis.The current most widely used medical term is ""recurrent aphthous stomatitis"" or simply ""aphthous stomatitis"". Historically many different terms have been used to refer to recurrent aphthous stomatitis or its sub-types and some are still in use. Mikuliczs aphthae is a synonym of minor RAS named after Jan Mikulicz-Radecki. Synonyms for major RAS include Suttons ulcers (named after Richard Lightburn Sutton) Suttons disease Suttons syndrome and periadenitis mucosa necrotica recurrens. Synonyms for aphthous stomatitis as a whole include (recurrent) oral aphthae (recurrent) aphthous ulceration and (oral) aphthosis.In traditional Chinese medicine claimed treatments for aphthae focus on clearing heat and nourishing Yin.Rembrandt Gentle White toothpaste did not contain sodium lauryl sulfate and was specifically marketed as being for the benefit of ""canker sore sufferers"". When the manufacturer Johnson & Johnson discontinued the product in 2014 it caused a backlash of anger from long-term customers and the toothpaste began to sell for many times the original price on the auction website eBay.See alsoAcute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis also known as ""trench mouth""—another painful non-contagious mouth infection with similar symptomsMouth ulcerReferencesExternal links Learning materials related to Oral ulceration at WikiversityAphthous stomatitis at Curlie"

18,Apnea of prematurity is defined as cessation of breathing by a premature infant that lasts for more than 20 seconds and/or is accompanied by hypoxia or bradycardia. Apnea is traditionally classified as either obstructive central or mixed. Obstructive apnea may occur when the infants neck is hyperflexed or conversely hyperextended.  It may also occur due to low pharyngeal muscle tone or to inflammation of the soft tissues which can block the flow of air though the pharynx and vocal cords. Central apnea occurs when there is a lack of respiratory effort. This may result from central nervous system immaturity or from the effects of medications or illness. Many episodes of apnea of prematurity may start as either obstructive or central but then involve elements of both becoming mixed in nature.PathophysiologyVentilatory drive is primarily dependent on response to increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and acid in the blood. A secondary stimulus is hypoxia. Responses to these stimuli are impaired in premature infants due to immaturity of specialized regions of the brain that sense these changes.  In addition premature infants have an exaggerated response to laryngeal stimulation (a normal reflex that closes the airway as a protective measure).DiagnosisApnea of prematurity can be readily identified from other forms of infant apnea such as obstructive apnea hypoventilation syndromes breathing regulation issues during feeding and reflux associated apnea with an infant pneumogram or infant apnea/sleep study.It has been reported that the incidence of neonatal apnea happens in almost all infants with gestational age of less than 29 weeks or the birth weight of less than 1000g.TreatmentMedicationsMethylxanthines (theophylline and caffeine) have been used for almost three decades to treat apnea of prematurity. Despite this prevalent use there are concerns of long term negative effects from the use of caffeine. Caffeine and theophylline have similar short-term effects on apnea but theophylline is associated with higher rates of toxicity.Respiratory supportSimple tactile stimulation by touching the skin or patting the infant may stop an apneic episode by raising the infants level of alertness.  Increasing the environmental oxygen level by placing the infant in a tent or hood with supplemental oxygen can diminish the frequency of AOP and may also help the infant maintain adequate oxygenation during short episodes of apnea.  Increased oxygen at low levels can also be delivered using a nasal cannula which additionally may provide some stimulation due to the tactile stimulation of the cannula.  CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is sometimes used for apnea when medications and supplemental oxygen are not sufficient.  Usually as a last resort mechanical ventilation is used to support infants whose apnea cannot be controlled sufficiently by other methods and where the potential risk of harm from recurrent hypoxia is felt to outweigh the risks of injury from ventilation.MonitoringIn-hospital monitors in the NICU typically measure respiratory movements heartrate and pulse oximetry.  Central apnea can be detected quickly since it results in absence of respiratory movements.  Obstructive apnea can be detected when the level of oxygen has declined in the blood and/or results in slowing of the heart rate.Home apnea monitors (which must be distinguished from infant monitors that are designed only to allow parents to listen to the infant remotely) most frequently measure only respiratory movements and/or heart rate.  They are generally used with premature infants who are otherwise ready for discharge but who continue to require supplemental oxygen or medication for mild residual AOP.  Home apnea monitoring is typically required for 6–12 weeks after discharge.OutcomeSince AOP is fundamentally a problem of the immaturity of the physiological systems of the premature infant it is a self-limited condition that will resolve when these systems mature.  It is unusual for an infant to continue to have significant problems with AOP beyond 43 weeks post-conceptual age.Infants who have had AOP are at increased risk of recurrence of apnea in response to exposure to anesthetic agents at least until around 52 weeks post-conceptual age.There is no evidence that a history of AOP places an infant at increased risk for SIDS.  However any premature infant (regardless of whether they have had AOP) is at increased risk of SIDS.  It is important that other factors related to SIDS risk be avoided (exposure to smoking prone sleeping excess bedding materials etc.)EpidemiologyApnea of prematurity occurs in at least 85 percent of infants who are born at less than 34 weeks of gestation. The incidence is inversely related to the gestational maturity of the infant but has considerable individual variability.References== External links ==
19,"Arsenic poisoning is a medical condition that occurs due to elevated levels of arsenic in the body. If arsenic poisoning occurs over a brief period of time symptoms may include vomiting abdominal pain encephalopathy and watery diarrhea that contains blood. Long-term exposure can result in thickening of the skin darker skin abdominal pain diarrhea heart disease numbness and cancer.The most common reason for long-term exposure is contaminated drinking water. Groundwater most often becomes contaminated naturally; however contamination may also occur from mining or agriculture. It may also be found in the soil and air. Recommended levels in water are less than 10–50 µg/L (10–50 parts per billion). Other routes of exposure include toxic waste sites and traditional medicines. Most cases of poisoning are accidental. Arsenic acts by changing the functioning of around 200 enzymes. Diagnosis is by testing the urine blood or hair.Prevention is by using water that does not contain high levels of arsenic. This may be achieved by the use of special filters or using rainwater. There is not good evidence to support specific treatments for long-term poisoning. For acute poisonings treating dehydration is important. Dimercaptosuccinic acid or dimercaptopropane sulfonate may be used while dimercaprol (BAL) is not recommended. Hemodialysis may also be used.Through drinking water more than 200 million people globally are exposed to higher-than-safe levels of arsenic. The areas most affected are Bangladesh and West Bengal. Exposure is also more common in people of low income and minorities. Acute poisoning is uncommon. The toxicity of arsenic has been described as far back as 1500 BC in the Ebers papyrus.Signs and symptomsSymptoms of arsenic poisoning begin with headaches confusion severe diarrhea and drowsiness. As the poisoning develops convulsions and changes in fingernail pigmentation called leukonychia striata (Meess lines or Aldrich-Meess lines) may occur. When the poisoning becomes acute symptoms may include diarrhea vomiting vomiting blood blood in the urine cramping muscles hair loss stomach pain and more convulsions. The organs of the body that are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs skin kidneys and liver. The final result of arsenic poisoning is coma and death.Arsenic is related to heart disease (hypertension-related cardiovascular disease) cancer stroke (cerebrovascular diseases) chronic lower respiratory diseases and diabetes. Skin effects can include skin cancer in the long term but often prior to skin cancer are different skin lesions. Other effects may include darkening of skin and thickening of skin.Chronic exposure to arsenic is related to vitamin A deficiency which is related to heart disease and night blindness. The acute minimal lethal dose of arsenic in adults is estimated to be 70 to 200 mg or 1 mg/kg/day.CancerArsenic increases the risk of cancer. Exposure is related to skin lung liver and kidney cancer among others.Its comutagenic effects may be explained by interference with base and nucleotide excision repair eventually through interaction with zinc finger structures. Dimethylarsinic acid DMA(V) caused DNA single strand breaks resulting from inhibition of repair enzymes at levels of 5 to 100 mM in human epithelial type II cells.MMA(III) and DMA(III) were also shown to be directly genotoxic by effectuating scissions in supercoiled ΦX174 DNA. Increased arsenic exposure is associated with an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations micronuclei and sister-chromatid exchanges. An explanation for chromosomal aberrations is the sensitivity of the protein tubulin and the mitotic spindle to arsenic. Histological observations confirm effects on cellular integrity shape and locomotion.DMA(III) is able to form reactive oxygen species by reaction with molecular oxygen. Resulting metabolites are the dimethylarsenic radical and the dimethylarsenic peroxyl radical.Both DMA(III) and DMA(V) were shown to release iron from horse spleen as well as from human liver ferritin if ascorbic acid was administered simultaneously. Thus formation of reactive oxygen species can be promoted.Moreover arsenic could cause oxidative stress by depleting the cells antioxidants especially the ones containing thiol groups. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species like that cited above and hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxides causes aberrant gene expression at low concentrations and lesions of lipids proteins and DNA in higher concentrations which eventually lead to cellular death.In a rat animal model urine levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (as a biomarker of DNA damage byreactive oxygen species) were measured after treatment with DMA(V). In comparison to control levels they turned out to be significantly increased. This theory is further supported by a cross-sectional study which found elevated mean serum lipid peroxides in the As exposed individuals which correlated with blood levels of inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites and inversely correlated with nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in whole blood. Another study found an association of As levels in whole blood with the level of reactive oxidants in plasma and an inverse relationship with plasma antioxidants. A finding of the latter study indicates that methylation might in fact be a detoxification pathway with regard to oxidative stress: the results showed that the lower the As methylation capacity was the lower the level of plasma antioxidant capacity. As reviewed by Kitchin (2001) the oxidative stress theory provides an explanation for the preferred tumor sites connected with arsenic exposure. Considering that a high partial pressure of oxygen is present in lungs and DMA(III) is excreted in gaseous state via the lungs this seems to be a plausible mechanism for special vulnerability. The fact that DMA is produced by methylation in the liver excreted via the kidneys and later on stored in the bladder accounts for the other tumor localizations.Regarding DNA methylation some studies suggest interaction of As with methyltransferases which leads to an inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through hypermethylation; others state that hypomethylation might occur due to a lack of SAM resulting in aberrant gene activation. An experiment by Zhong et al. (2001) with arsenite-exposed human lung A549 kidney UOK123 UOK109 and UOK121 cells isolated eight different DNA fragments by methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions. It turned out that six of the fragments were hyper- and two of them were hypomethylated. Higher levels of DNA methyltransferase mRNA and enzyme activity were found.Kitchin (2001) proposed a model of altered growth factors which lead to cell proliferation and thus to carcinogenesis. From observations it is known that chronic low-dose arsenic poisoning can lead to increased tolerance to its acute toxicity. MRP1-overexpressing lung tumor GLC4/Sb30 cells poorly accumulate arsenite and arsenate. This is mediated through MRP-1 dependent efflux. The efflux requires glutathione but no arsenic-glutathione complex formation.Although many mechanisms have been proposed no definite model can be given for the mechanisms of chronic arsenic poisoning. The prevailing events of toxicity and carcinogenicity might be quite tissue-specific. Current consensus on the mode of carcinogenesis is that it acts primarily as a tumor promoter. Its co-carcinogenicity has been demonstrated in several models. However the finding of several studies that chronically arsenic-exposed Andean populations (as most extremely exposed to UV-light) do not develop skin cancer with chronic arsenic exposure is puzzling.CausesOrganic arsenic is less harmful than inorganic arsenic. Seafood is a common source of the less toxic organic arsenic in the form of arsenobetaine. The arsenic reported in 2012 in fruit juice and rice by Consumer Reports was primarily inorganic arsenic. Because of its high toxicity arsenic is seldom used in the Western world although in Asia it is still a popular pesticide. Arsenic is mainly encountered occupationally in the smelting of zinc and copper ores.Drinking waterArsenic is naturally found in groundwater and presents serious health threats when high amounts exist. Chronic arsenic poisoning results from drinking contaminated well water over a long period of time. Many aquifers contain high concentration of arsenic salts.  The World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for drinking water quality established in 1993 a provisional guideline value of 0.01 mg/L (10 parts per billion) for maximum contaminant levels of arsenic in drinking water. This recommendation was established based on the limit of detection for most laboratories testing equipment at the time of publication of the WHO water quality guidelines. More recent findings show that consumption of water with levels as low as 0.00017 mg/L (0.17 parts per billion) over long periods of time can lead to arsenicosis.From a 1988 study in China the US protection agency quantified the lifetime exposure of arsenic in drinking water at concentrations of 0.0017 mg/L (1.7 ppb) 0.00017 mg/L and 0.000017 mg/L are associated with a lifetime skin cancer risk of 1 in 10000 1 in 100000 and 1 in 1000000 respectively. WHO asserts that a water level of 0.01 mg/L (10 ppb) poses a risk of 6 in 10000 chance of lifetime skin cancer risk and contends that this level of risk is acceptable.One of the worst incidents of arsenic poisoning via well water occurred in Bangladesh which the World Health Organization called the ""largest mass poisoning of a population in history"" recognized as a major public health concern. The contamination in the Ganga-Brahmaputra fluvial plains in India and Padma-Meghna fluvial plains in Bangladesh demonstrated adverse impacts on human health.Mining techniques such as hydraulic fracturing may mobilize arsenic in groundwater and aquifers due to enhanced methane transport and resulting changes in redox conditions and inject fluid containing additional arsenic.GroundwaterIn the US the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the median groundwater concentration is 1 μg/L or less although some groundwater aquifers particularly in the western United States can contain much higher levels. For example median levels in Nevada were about 8 μg/L but levels of naturally occurring arsenic as high as 1000 μg/L have been measured in the United States in drinking water.Geothermally active zones occur at hotspots where mantle-derived plumes ascend such as in Hawaii and Yellowstone National Park US. Arsenic is an incompatible element (does not fit easily into the lattices of common rock-forming minerals). Concentrations of arsenic are high mainly in geothermal waters that leach continental rocks. Arsenic in hot geothermal fluids was shown to be derived mainly from leaching of host rocks at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming US rather than from magmas.In the western US there are As (arsenic) inputs to groundwater and surface water from geothermal fluids in and near Yellowstone National Park and in other western mineralized areas. Groundwater associated with volcanics in California contain As at concentrations ranging up to 48000 μg/L with As-bearing sulfide minerals as the main source. Geothermal waters on Dominica in the Lesser Antilles also contain concentrations of As >50 μg/L.In general because arsenic is an incompatible element it accumulates in differentiated magmas and in other western mineralized areas. Weathering of pegmatite veins in Connecticut US was thought to contribute As to groundwater.In Pennsylvania As concentrations in water discharging from abandoned anthracite mines ranged from <0.03 to 15 μg/L and from abandoned bituminous mines from 0.10 to 64 μg/L with 10% of samples exceeding the United States Environmental Protection Agency MLC of 10 μg/L.In Wisconsin As concentrations of water in sandstone and dolomite aquifers were as high as 100 μg/L. Oxidation of pyrite hosted by these formations was the likely source of the As.In the Piedmont of Pennsylvania and New Jersey groundwater in Mesozoic age aquifers contains elevated levels of As—domestic well waters from Pennsylvania contained up to 65 μg/L whereas in New Jersey the highest concentration measured recently was 215 μg/L.FoodIn the United States Schoof et al. estimated an average adult intake of 3.2 μg/day with a range of 1–20 μg/day. Estimates for children were similar. Food also contains many organic arsenic compounds. The key organic arsenic compounds that can be routinely found in food (depending on food type) include monomethylarsonic acid (MMAsV) dimethylarsinic acid (DMAsV) arsenobetaine arsenocholine arsenosugars and arsenolipids. DMAsV or MMAsV can be found in various types of fin fish crabs and mollusks but often at very low levels.Arsenobetaine is the major form of arsenic in marine animals and by all accounts it is considered a compound that is nontoxic under conditions of human consumption. Arsenocholine which is mainly found in shrimp is chemically similar to arsenobetaine and is considered to be ""essentially nontoxic"". Although arsenobetaine is little studied available information indicates it is not mutagenic immunotoxic or embryotoxic.Arsenosugars and arsenolipids have recently been identified. Exposure to these compounds and toxicological implications are currently being studied. Arsenosugars are detected mainly in seaweed but are also found to a lesser extent in marine mollusks. Studies addressing arsenosugar toxicity however have largely been limited to in vitro studies which show that arsenosugars are significantly less toxic than both inorganic arsenic and trivalent methylated arsenic metabolites.It has been found that rice is particularly susceptible to accumulation of arsenic from soil.  Rice grown in the United States has an average 260 ppb of arsenic according to a study; but U.S. arsenic intake remains far below World Health Organization-recommended limits.  China has set a standard for arsenic limits in food (150 ppb) as levels in rice exceed those in water.Arsenic is a ubiquitous element present in American drinking water. In the United States levels of arsenic that are above natural levels but still well below danger levels set in federal safety standards have been detected in commercially raised chickens. The source of the arsenic appears to be the feed additives roxarsone and nitarsone which are used to control the parasitic infection coccidiosis as well as to increase weight and skin coloring of the poultry.High levels of inorganic arsenic were reportedly found in 83 California wines in 2015.SoilExposure to arsenic in soil can occur through multiple pathways. Compared with the intake of naturally occurring arsenic from water and the diet soil arsenic constitutes only a small fraction of intake.AirThe European Commission (2000) reports that levels of arsenic in air range 0–1 ng/m3 in remote areas 0.2–1.5 ng/m3 in rural areas 0.5–3 ng/m3 in urban areas and up to about 50 ng/m3 in the vicinity of industrial sites. Based on these data the European Commission (2000) estimated that in relation to food cigarette smoking water and soil air contributes less than 1% of total arsenic exposure.PesticidesThe use of lead arsenate pesticides has been effectively eliminated for over 50 years. However because of the pesticides environmental persistence it is estimated that millions of acres of land are still contaminated with lead arsenate residues. This presents a potentially significant public health concern in some areas of the United States (e.g. New Jersey Washington and Wisconsin) where large areas of land used historically as orchards have been converted into residential developments.Some modern uses of arsenic-based pesticides still exist. Chromated copper arsenate has been registered for use in the United States since the 1940s as a wood preservative protecting wood from insects and microbial agents. In 2003 manufacturers of chromated copper arsenate instituted a voluntary recall of residential uses of wood treated with the chemical. The Environmental Protection Agency Act2008 final report stated that chromated copper arsenate is still approved for use in nonresidential applications such as in marine facilities (pilings and structures) utility poles and sand highway structures.Copper smeltingExposure studies in the copper smelting industry are much more extensive and have established definitive links between arsenic a by-product of copper smelting and lung cancer via inhalation. Dermal and neurological effects were also increased in some of these studies. Although as time went on occupational controls became more stringent and workers were exposed to reduced arsenic concentrations the arsenic exposures measured from these studies ranged from about 0.05 to 0.3 mg/m3 and are significantly higher than airborne environmental exposures to arsenic (which range from 0 to 0.000003 mg/m3).PathophysiologyArsenic interferes with cellular longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by NAD+. With the enzyme inhibited the energy system of the cell is disrupted resulting in cellular apoptosis. Biochemically arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a clinical picture resembling thiamine deficiency. Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to lactic acidosis. Low potassium levels in the cells increases the risk of experiencing a life-threatening heart rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide.Arsenic in cells clearly stimulates the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When the H2O2 reacts with certain metals such as iron or manganese it produces a highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Inorganic arsenic trioxide found in ground water particularly affects voltage-gated potassium channelsdisrupting cellular electrolytic function resulting in neurological disturbances cardiovascular episodes such as prolonged QT interval neutropenia high blood pressurecentral nervous system dysfunction anemia and death.Arsenic exposure plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular endothelial dysfunction as it inactivates endothelial nitric oxide synthase leading to reduction in the generation and bioavailability of nitric oxide. In addition the chronic arsenic exposure induces high oxidative stress which may affect the structure and function of cardiovascular system. Further the arsenic exposure has been noted to induce atherosclerosis by increasing the platelet aggregation and reducing fibrinolysis. Moreover arsenic exposure may cause arrhythmia by increasing the QT interval and accelerating the cellular calcium overload. The chronic exposure to arsenic upregulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule and vascular endothelial growth factor to induce cardiovascular pathogenesis.Arsenic has also been shown to induce cardiac hypertrophy by activating certain transcription factors involved in pathologically remodeling the heart. Tissue culture studies have shown that arsenic compounds block both IKr and Iks channels and at the same time activate IK-ATP channels. Arsenic compounds also disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+ mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system organ failure probably from necrotic cell death not apoptosis. A post mortem reveals brick red colored mucosa due to severe hemorrhage.  Although arsenic causes toxicity it can also play a protective role.MechanismArsenite inhibits not only the formation of acetyl-CoA but also the enzyme succinic dehydrogenase. Arsenate can replace phosphate in many reactions. It is able to form Glc-6-arsenate in vitro; therefore it has been argued that hexokinase could be inhibited. (Eventually this may be a mechanism leading to muscle weakness in chronic arsenic poisoning.) In the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction arsenate attacks the enzyme-bound thioester. The formed 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate is unstable and hydrolyzes spontaneously. Thus ATP formation in glycolysis is inhibited while bypassing the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction. (Moreover the formation of 23-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes might be affected followed by a higher oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and subsequently enhanced cyanosis.) As shown by Gresser (1981) submitochondrial particles synthesize adenosine-5-diphosphate-arsenate from ADP and arsenate in presence of succinate. Thus by a variety of mechanisms arsenate leads to an impairment of cell respiration and subsequently diminished ATP formation. This is consistent with observed ATP depletion of exposed cells and histopathological findings of mitochondrial and cell swelling glycogen depletion in liver cells and fatty change in liver heart and kidney.Experiments demonstrated enhanced arterial thrombosis in a rat animal model elevations of serotonin levels thromboxane A[2] and adhesion proteins in platelets while human platelets showed similar responses. The effect on vascular endothelium may eventually be mediated by the arsenic-induced formation of nitric oxide.It was demonstrated that +3 As concentrations substantially lower than concentrations required for inhibition of the lysosomal protease cathepsin L in B cell line TA3 were sufficient to trigger apoptosis in the same B cell line while the latter could be a mechanism mediating immunosuppressive effects.KineticsThe two forms of inorganic arsenic reduced (trivalent As(III)) and oxidized (pentavalent As(V)) can be absorbed and accumulated in tissues and body fluids. In the liver the metabolism of arsenic involves enzymatic and non-enzymatic methylation; the most frequently excreted metabolite (≥ 90%) in the urine of mammals is dimethylarsinic acid or cacodylic acid DMA(V). Dimethylarsenic acid is also known as Agent Blue and was used as herbicide in the American war in Vietnam.In humans inorganic arsenic is reduced nonenzymatically from pentoxide to trioxide using glutathione or it is mediated by enzymes. Reduction of arsenic pentoxide to arsenic trioxide increases its toxicity and bio availability Methylation occurs through methyltransferase enzymes. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) may serve as methyl donor. Various pathways are used the principal route being dependent on the current environment of the cell. Resulting metabolites are monomethylarsonous acid MMA(III) and dimethylarsinous acid DMA(III).Methylation had been regarded as a detoxification process but reduction from +5 As to +3 As may be considered as a bioactivation instead. Another suggestion is that methylation might be a detoxification if ""As[III] intermediates are not permitted to accumulate"" because the pentavalent organoarsenics have a lower affinity to thiol groups than inorganic pentavalent arsenics. Gebel (2002) stated that methylation is a detoxification through accelerated excretion. With regard to carcinogenicity it has been suggested that methylation should be regarded as a toxification.Arsenic especially +3 As binds to single but with higher affinity to vicinal sulfhydryl groups thus reacts with a variety of proteins and inhibits their activity. It was also proposed that binding of arsenite at nonessential sites might contribute to detoxification. Arsenite inhibits members of the disulfide oxidoreductase family like glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase.The remaining unbound arsenic (≤ 10%) accumulates in cells which over time may lead to skin bladder kidney liver lung and prostate cancers. Other forms of arsenic toxicity in humans have been observed in blood bone marrow cardiac central nervous system gastrointestinal gonadal kidney liver pancreatic and skin tissues.Heat shock responseAnother aspect is the similarity of arsenic effects to the heat shock response. Short-term arsenic exposure has effects on signal transduction inducing heat shock proteins with masses of 27 60 70 72 90 and 110 kDa as well as metallothionein ubiquitin mitogen-activated [MAP] kinases extracellular regulated kinase [ERK] c-jun terminal kinases [JNK] and p38.Via JNK and p38 it activates c-fos c-jun and egr-1 which are usually activated by growth factors and cytokines. The effects are largely dependent on the dosing regime and may be as well inversed.As shown by some experiments reviewed by Del Razo (2001) reactive oxygen species induced by low levels of inorganic arsenic increase the transcription and the activity of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (maybe enhanced by elevated MAPK levels) which results in c-fos/c-jun activation over-secretion of pro-inflammatory and growth promoting cytokines stimulating cell proliferation. Germolec et al. (1996) found an increased cytokine expression and cell proliferation in skin biopsies from individuals chronically exposed to arsenic-contaminated drinking water.Increased AP-1 and NF-κB obviously also result in an up-regulation of mdm2 protein which decreases p53 protein levels. Thus taking into account p53s function a lack of it could cause a faster accumulation of mutations contributing to carcinogenesis. However high levels of inorganic arsenic inhibit NF-κB activation and cell proliferation. An experiment of Hu et al. (2002) demonstrated increased binding activity of AP-1 and NF-κB after acute (24 h) exposure to +3 sodium arsenite whereas long-term exposure (10–12 weeks) yielded the opposite result. The authors conclude that the former may be interpreted as a defense response while the latter could lead to carcinogenesis. As the contradicting findings and connected mechanistic hypotheses indicate there is a difference in acute and chronic effects of arsenic on signal transduction which is not clearly understood yet.Oxidative stressStudies have demonstrated that the oxidative stress generated by arsenic may disrupt the signal transduction pathways of the nuclear transcriptional factors PPARs AP-1 and NF-κB as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-α.  The interference of oxidative stress with signal transduction pathways may affect physiological processes associated with cell growth metabolic syndrome X glucose homeostasis lipid metabolism obesity insulin resistance inflammation and diabetes-2. Recent scientific evidence has elucidated the physiological roles of the PPARs in the ω- hydroxylation of fatty acids and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB and AP-1) pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 -6 -8 -12 and TNF-α) cell4 adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) inducible nitric oxide synthase proinflammatory nitric oxide (NO) and anti-apoptotic factors.Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The human liver after exposure to therapeutic drugs may exhibit hepatic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension fibrosis and cirrhosis. However the literature provides insufficient scientific evidence to show cause and effect between arsenic and the onset of diabetes mellitus Type 2.DiagnosisArsenic may be measured in blood or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal over dosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Organic arsenic compounds tend to be eliminated in the urine in unchanged form while inorganic forms are largely converted to organic arsenic compounds in the body prior to urinary excretion. The current biological exposure index for U.S. workers of 35 µg/L total urinary arsenic may easily be exceeded by a healthy person eating a seafood meal.Tests are available to diagnose poisoning by measuring arsenic in blood urine hair and fingernails. The urine test is the most reliable test for arsenic exposure within the last few days. Urine testing needs to be done within 24–48 hours for an accurate analysis of an acute exposure. Tests on hair and fingernails can measure exposure to high levels of arsenic over the past 6–12 months. These tests can determine if one has been exposed to above-average levels of arsenic. They cannot predict however whether the arsenic levels in the body will affect health. Chronic arsenic exposure can remain in the body systems for a longer period of time than a shorter term or more isolated exposure and can be detected in a longer time frame after the introduction of the arsenic important in trying to determine the source of the exposure.Hair is a potential bioindicator for arsenic exposure due to its ability to store trace elements from blood. Incorporated elements maintain their position during growth of hair. Thus for a temporal estimation of exposure an assay of hair composition needs to be carried out with a single hair which is not possible with older techniques requiring homogenization and dissolution of several strands of hair. This type of biomonitoring has been achieved with newer microanalytical techniques like synchrotron radiation based X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and microparticle induced X-ray emission. The highly focused and intense beams study small spots on biological samples allowing analysis to micro level along with the chemical speciation. In a study this method has been used to follow arsenic level before during and after treatment with arsenious oxide in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.TreatmentChelationDimercaprol and dimercaptosuccinic acid are chelating agents that sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins and are used in treating acute arsenic poisoning.  The most important side effect is hypertension.  Dimercaprol is considerably more toxic than succimer. dimercaptosuccinic acid monoesters e.g. MiADMSA are promising antidotes for arsenic poisoning.NutritionSupplemental potassium decreases the risk of experiencing a life-threatening heart rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide.HistoryBeginning in about 3000 BC arsenic was mined and added to copper in the alloying of bronze but the adverse health effects of working with arsenic led to it being abandoned when a viable alternative tin was discovered.In addition to its presence as a poison for centuries arsenic was used medicinally. It has been used for over 2400 years as a part of traditional Chinese medicine. In the western world arsenic compounds such as salvarsan were used extensively to treat syphilis before penicillin was introduced. It was eventually replaced as a therapeutic agent by sulfa drugs and then by other antibiotics. Arsenic was also an ingredient in many tonics (or ""patent medicines"").In addition during the Elizabethan era some women used a mixture of vinegar chalk and arsenic applied topically to whiten their skin. This use of arsenic was intended to prevent aging and creasing of the skin but some arsenic was inevitably absorbed into the blood stream.During the Victorian era (late 19th century) in the United States U.S. newspapers advertised ""arsenic complexion wafers"" that promised to remove facial blemishes such as moles and pimples.Some pigments most notably the popular Emerald Green (known also under several other names) were based on arsenic compounds. Overexposure to these pigments was a frequent cause of accidental poisoning of artists and craftsmen.Arsenic became a favored method for murder of the Middle Ages and Renaissance particularly among ruling classes in Italy allegedly. Because the symptoms are similar to those of cholera which was common at the time arsenic poisoning often went undetected.: 63   By the 19th century it had acquired the nickname ""inheritance powder"" perhaps because impatient heirs were known or suspected to use it to ensure or accelerate their inheritances.: 21  It was also a common murder technique in the 19th century in domestic violence situations such as the case of Rebecca Copin who attempted to poison her husband by ""putting arsenic in his coffee"".In post-WW1 Hungary arsenic extracted by boiling fly paper was used in an estimated 300 murders by the Angel Makers of Nagyrév.In imperial China arsenic trioxide and sulfides were used in murder as well as for capital punishment for members of the royal family or aristocracy.  Forensic studies have determined that the Guangxu Emperor (d. 1908) was murdered by arsenic most likely ordered by the Empress Dowager Cixi or Generalissimo Yuan Shikai.  Likewise in ancient Korea and particularly in the Joseon Dynasty arsenic-sulfur compounds have been used as a major ingredient of sayak (사약; 賜藥) which was a poison cocktail used in capital punishment of high-profile political figures and members of the royal family. Due to social and political prominence of the condemned many of these events were well-documented often in the Annals of Joseon Dynasty; they are sometimes portrayed in historical television miniseries because of their dramatic nature.LegislationIn the U.S. in 1975 under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency determined the National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulation levels of arsenic (inorganic contaminant – IOCs) to be 0.05 mg/L (50 parts per billion – ppb).Throughout the years many studies reported dose-dependent effects of arsenic in drinking water and skin cancer. In order to prevent new cases and death from cancerous and non-cancerous diseases the Safe Drinking Water Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to revise arsenics levels and specified the maximum contaminant level (MCL). MCLs are set as close to the health goals as possible considering cost benefits and the ability of public water systems to detect and remove contaminants using suitable treatment technologies.In 2001 Environmental Protection Agency adopted a lower standard of MCL 0.01 mg/L (10 ppb) for arsenic in drinking water that applies to both community water systems and non-transient non-community water systems.In some other countries when developing national drinking water standards based on the guideline values it is necessary to take account of a variety of geographical socio-economic dietary and other conditions affecting potential exposure. These factors lead to national standards that differ appreciably from the guideline values. That is the case in countries such as India and Bangladesh where the permissible limit of arsenic in absence of an alternative source of water is 0.05 mg/L.Challenges to implementationArsenic removal technologies are traditional treatment processes which have been tailored to improve removal of arsenic from drinking water. Although some of the removal processes such as precipitative processes adsorption processes ion exchange processes and separation (membrane) processes may be technically feasible their cost may be prohibitive.For underdeveloped countries the challenge is finding the means to fund such technologies. The Environmental Protection Agency for example has estimated the total national annualized cost of treatment monitoring reporting record keeping and administration to enforce the MCL rule to be approximately $181 million. Most of the cost is due to the installation and operation of the treatment technologies needed to reduce arsenic in public water systems.PregnancyArsenic exposure through groundwater is highly concerning throughout the perinatal period. Pregnant women are a high-risk population because not only are the mothers at risk for adverse outcomes but in-utero exposure also poses health risks to the infant.There is a dose-dependent relationship between maternal exposure to arsenic and infant mortality meaning that infants born to women exposed to higher concentrations or exposed for longer periods of time have a higher mortality rate.Studies have shown that ingesting arsenic through groundwater during pregnancy poses dangers to the mother including but not limited to abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea skin pigmentation changes and cancer. Research has also demonstrated that arsenic exposure also causes low birth weight low birth size infant mortality and a variety of other outcomes in infants. Some of these effects like lower birth-rate and size may be due to the effects of arsenic on maternal weight gain during pregnancy.See also2007 Peruvian meteorite event – a meteorite impact believed to have caused arsenic poisoningArsenic contamination of groundwaterMary Ann Cotton – serial arsenic poisonerFelicia Dorothea Kate Dover –  arsenic poisonerJames Marsh (chemist) – invented the Marsh test for detecting arsenicToroku arsenic diseaseReferencesFurther readingAtlas (color) of Chronic Arsenic Poisoning (2010) Nobuyuki Hotta Ichiro Kikuchi Yasuko Kojo Sakuragaoka Hospital Kumamoto ISBN 978-4-9905256-0-6.A 2011 article in the journal Social Medicine discusses community interventions to combat arsenic poisoning: Beyond medical treatment arsenic poisoning in rural Bangladesh.D.
